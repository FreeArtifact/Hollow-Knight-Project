            the flame and gather within itself that burning essence.&lt;page&gt;Like you, the child
            plays key role in this task. Only with it by your side will the flame, and my kin,
            reveal themselves to you.</entry>

            Ritual. For the troupe. For the Master.&lt;page&gt;Even this child was born into

        <entry info="NYMM_DREAM">Hmm...Why did I choose to travel here? And how far must I have

        <entry info="NYMM_MEET">Ah. Hello! Hello! I'm new around these parts, so it's
            marvelous to see so friendly a face, in such a sad town.&lt;page&gt;The old bug over
            there was very welcoming, but still I find the place a little melancholy, what with the
            wind, and the darkness, and the sense of decline... I was hoping my music could go some
            way to livening up the place.&lt;page&gt;And now you've arrived with that wonderful,
            charming aura about you. The whole town feels brighter for it.&lt;page&gt;Before you
            hurry about your business, I've a small gift to commemorate a wonderful new
            friendship. No use for it myself, but I believe it'd look rather fancy upon
            you.&lt;page&gt;Please, enjoy it, and lets hope to see much more of one another about
            town.</entry>
        <entry info="DIVINE_GIFT_REFUSE">Eeuuarrggh! Refuse me, then!</entry>
        <entry info="NYMM_BRUMM_CHARM">Ahh. Just marvelous! I'm so glad you'd consider my
            gift worth wearing, and my, my, it does suit you well.&lt;page&gt;To be honest, I'm
            not even sure where I came upon it, but staring at its design, my memory stirs,
            something, and someone, forgotten, lost far away.&lt;page&gt;The specifics elude me, but
            a strange sense remains, fear, but also... longing? Like a strange nostalgia for
            something that never happened.&lt;page&gt;I've no need for it in any case, so
            I'm glad you're enjoying it.</entry>
        <entry info="GRIMMSTEED_DREAM_1">A new land. Different from the last. How many more will we
            see?</entry>
        <entry info="ELDERBUG_NYMM">Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and
            town's returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.&lt;page&gt;And
            we've gained a new addition to the square! I found the fellow just outside of town.
            Seemed a little confused at first. Claims to be from far away, though he's hazy on
            the details.&lt;page&gt;Whatever his past, he's a rather good musician, and this
            town's spent far too long listening only to the wind. Thanks to him, we've
            gained a new tune and some new company!</entry>
        <entry info="SLY_GRIMM">I've been hearing about the strangers that have come to town.
            They're strange indeed from what's been told.&lt;page&gt;What interest does this
            tired little place hold for them? I'm thinking you may know the answer to
            that.&lt;page&gt;None of my business of course, but I'd be wary of their deals and
            promises. Keep your nail half-drawn, if you understand me.</entry>

            act.&lt;page&gt;The Ritual plays itself out once more. We are like the notes in an old,
            old song. You and me. Mrmm.</entry>
        <entry info="JIJI_GRIMM">Hmm. A fierce host has settled nearby. Did you summon them? I find
            their smell... unsettling.&lt;page&gt;Theirs is a scent of distant places, unfamiliar
            even to me.&lt;page&gt;They have a strange look to them, gaudy and intimidating. Perhaps
            you suspect they hide their true appearance? You'd be right. They favour projection
            over truth, shrouding themselves in forms dreamed.&lt;page&gt;Best be careful. Assisting

            its end. Will you continue to harvest the flame, even though now you surely see the path

            and the town's returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like
            it.&lt;page&gt;It's quite enough to deal with just the occasional traveller. Whole

            talents... heehee.&lt;page&gt;Oh! I do apologise. I've just felt a rumbling down

            troupe.&lt;page&gt;The lantern has been lit, and your summons heeded. A fine stage you
            choose, this kingdom fallowed by worm and root, perfect earth upon which our Ritual
            shall take place.&lt;page&gt;And you, my friend. Your own part is far from over.</entry>
        <entry info="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_NF_1">Mrmm. You came.&lt;page&gt;You have gathered the flame and
            so the time for the ritual's completion is upon us. All you must do now is return to
            the Master...&lt;page&gt;Thus it goes, as it ever has. We are like the notes in an old,
            old song. You and me. Mrmm.&lt;page&gt;And yet... It is not merely by fortune that we
            meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master's scarlet
            eyes can not see us.&lt;page&gt;Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at
            all.&lt;page&gt;You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it
            so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in
            peace.&lt;page&gt;If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it
            began... </entry>
        <entry info="DIVINE_CHARM_EQUIPPED">Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!&lt;page&gt;That charm... beautiful!

        <entry info="ELDERBUG_GRIMM">Ahh! Look there! Something strange and sinister has suddenly

            us?&lt;page&gt;Ahhh. It doesn't matter. Don't tell me.&lt;page&gt;We came, and I
            can smell something. Something deep below us. I want it... I want it!</entry>
        <entry info="NYMM_FINAL">Dear friend, I heard a violent scream from below. Even my song
            could not mask such a horrible shriek. Was it pain, or rage? I find I'm rather
            sensitive to such things.&lt;page&gt;If you're planning to head down, please do stay
            safe. I'd be dreadfully upset if I forever lost your company.</entry>

            my gift back, do you?&lt;page&gt;Eeuuarrggh! So nasty, so cruel, if that's true!
            Once you give something as a gift it's lost to you forever!</entry>
        <entry info="MOTHSTONE_DREAM">Protect yourself... You are our last...</entry>
        <entry info="SLY_NYMM">Another bug's arrived. And quite a racket he's making in the

            instrument.&lt;page&gt;Why is it always the poor that decide to stay?</entry>
        <entry info="DIVINE_RECEIVED_GIFT">You like it very much, don't you? Your gift.

        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_TRUTH">My dapper gadfly, would you care to know how charms are made?
            I don't often tell my customers, what with the truth being a little morbid. But
            you're a sharp one so you may have guessed already.&lt;page&gt;Few ways a charm
            appears but mainly it's from final wish, a dying bug's potent desire
            crystallised into these gorgeous, powerful trinkets.&lt;page&gt;Now don't go getting
            too sad. There are exceptions of course, and really, it's quite beautiful, makes
            them all the more precious. Mmhhmm.&lt;page&gt;Just think of all the little bug souls
            that went into creating your collection! It's like a crowd of strangers in your
            pouch, or purse, or...err....wherever it is you keep them.</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_DREAM">...Dear dear, I really must hold it together, must appear
            calm, but this creature... is just divine...</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_MEET_3A">Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I can see
            you've started your own collection. Very nice! I'll show you some of my own, and
            you can take one home with you if you like!</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_MEET_1">Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you surprised me! Hello, hello! Come
            in, sweetling! Come in and make yourself at home.</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_MEET_3B">Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I'm
            surprised a stylish little gadfly like yourself isn't wearing any,
            actually.&lt;page&gt;Charms are gorgeous, mystical, one-of-a-kind accessories with a
            spark of power woven into their cores. Just wearing one is enough to change your life!
            You'll do things you never thought possible!&lt;page&gt;Take a look at some of the
            Charms I have for sale. You can take one home with you if you like!</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_OVERCHARM">It's a bit of a sin to wear too many Charms at once,
            isn't it? Sometimes less is more! Mmmm!&lt;page&gt;Yes, you shouldn't try to
            cram on more Charms than you can handle. The effect could be positively
            overwhelming!</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_COMBO">Do you wear a lot of Charms at once? It's a lot of fun
            isn't it, mixing and matching them to get the perfect combination?&lt;page&gt;I
            don't know whether you've noticed, but some Charms seem to like each other. Yes!
            Mmm! When Charms like each other, they shine even brighter and sing even more
            sweetly!&lt;page&gt;Even more reason to try all sorts of fun and surprising combinations
            of Charms! Mmmmmmm! You'll show me whenever you have a new favourite, right?</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_1">My dear. A blessing for you. With your excessive
            patronage and those startling good looks, you've more than earned it. </entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_NOSTOCK">Goodness, goodness. You've gone and bought all my lovely
            charms! What a stunning, colourful collection you've amassed. Mmmmmm! You're
            even more the attractive bug, clad in all those wonderful, sparkling
            things.&lt;page&gt;I may have nothing more to give, but you must come back and visit
            from time to time. Such a dashing figure frequenting my store. I bet the whole village
            is jealous. Mmm hmm!</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_MEET_2">I'm Salubra, and this is my cosy little Charm store. Did
            the townfolk out there tell you to come and visit me? Mmm, yes! This is a lovely little
            village isn't it? Warm and intimate and full of life.</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_1">Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you're building up quite the
            Charm collection, aren't you? Quite the little connoisseur. I'd bet you'd
            like to wear more Charms at once, hmm? I've got a special item for sale that I think
            you'll be very, verrrry interested in! Mmm! </entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_2">Oooohhhh! You flamboyant little gadfly! Your Charm
            collection has expanded quite a bit, hasn't it? I think it's about time you
            bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself!
            Mmmm!</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_3">Oooohhhh! Your charm collection is getting positively
            enormous! I'm so jealous! I think it's about time you bought another Notch so
            you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_4">Mmmmmmmmm! Look at you! Every time I see you,
            you've collected even more Charms! I think it's about time you bought another
            Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_2">Mmmmmm yess... I hope my blessing brings you everything
            you desire! Don't be a stranger sweetums.</entry>
        <entry info="CHARMSLUG_REPEAT">It's rare enough that someone enters my store, but even
            rarer to meet one so striking!&lt;page&gt;Those impressive horns! That fierce weapon.
            The air of mystery! Ooooh. It's enough to make me swoon.</entry>

        <entry info="FUNGAL_WASTES_GREET">Ahh my short friend, you've caught me at the perfect
            time. I'm just about finished charting these noxious caverns.&lt;page&gt;Very
            territorial types make their homes within this area. I'd suggest avoiding them where
            possible.&lt;page&gt;Further below some strange thin creatures gave me quite a scare.
            They seemed an intelligent bunch.&lt;page&gt;In my youth I'd have braved their caves
            but I fear my matured physique wouldn't be able to outrun them were they to turn
            violent.</entry>
        <entry info="GREENPATH_GREET">Isn't this a contrast from the Crossroads? Such a humid,
            lively place. The roads twist and turn in the most wonderful ways.&lt;page&gt;I've
            done my best to chart the area ahead, though I must admit some of the area's
            inhabitants proved quite a nuisance.</entry>
        <entry info="CROSSROADS_BOUGHT">How are you finding my map? I've tried to fill out as
            much as I can, but every map is a work in progress.&lt;page&gt;If you'd like to fill
            out some of the map yourself you can purchase some mapping supplies from my wife up in
            Dirtmouth. We've set up a little store to help make ends meet.</entry>
        <entry info="MINES_GREET">Come to scale the mountain? I've heard tale of a summit way up
            there. Too far for me though and I'm not really one for heights. </entry>
        <entry condition="AGAIN_DP">Y-you want to buy a map after all?</entry>
        <entry info="CROSSROADS_GREET">Hello again! Still winding your way through these beautiful
            highways? Just imagine how they must have looked during the kingdom's height, thick
            with traffic and bustling with life! I wish I could have seen it.&lt;page&gt;Oh, and I
            suppose I should ask... are you interested in buying a copy of my map for this
            area...?</entry>
        <entry info="FUNGAL_WASTES_BOUGHT">There's a potent odour about these caverns and far
            worse for me I suspect. My trunk is quite sensitive whereas you don't seem to
            possess a scent organ of any kind.&lt;page&gt;Is it that you cannot smell at
            all?</entry>
        <entry info="CLIFFS_GREET">Enjoying the bracing air? We're quite close to
            Hallownest's borders and those desolate plains that surround it. &lt;page&gt;In this
            direction, I'm about as far as I'm willing to go, though it's been a
            pleasant change from the tight confines of the caverns.&lt;page&gt;I've drawn out a
            small map for the area. It's a simple one and more for completion really. Not
            knowing the full extents of a region can be quite frustrating.</entry>
        <entry info="FOG_CANYON_GREET">Ho ho! As odd as much of Hallownest can be, there's a
            whole new level of strangeness about these caves.&lt;page&gt;Did you see that dark gate
            below? It's quite unsettling to be near. I did my best to avoid
            it.&lt;page&gt;Fortunate for me, I found another route in, though I did end up a little
            singed after wading through some acid.</entry>
        <entry info="MINES_BOUGHT">I jabbed myself on one of those crystals back there. Awful sharp
            they are and all over the place. You'd best watch yourself if you're heading up. </entry>
        <entry info="WATERWAYS_BOUGHT">I'd wager these pipes and chambers were once used to
            carry the city's waste. Would've been a horrid stench down here. Thankfully that
            constant rain has flushed them clean. </entry>
        <entry info="DREAM">...To chart the world. What joy... If only Iselda could share the
            thrill...</entry>
        <entry info="ABYSS_GREET">Old caverns these ones. Can't you just feel the weight of the
            kingdom above? It's a heavy thing alright. &lt;page&gt;I reckon not many'd reach
            these depths. We're pioneers you and I, at least in recent history.</entry>
        <entry condition="ISELDA">A map can be a useful thing, but it alone won't show you
            where you are. If you've not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a compass
            from my wife, Iselda.&lt;page&gt;She's just now opening our new map shop in
            Dirtmouth, selling all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself. She'll
            even sell some of my old maps from time to time.&lt;page&gt;I pop back to see her
            whenever I finish mapping an area. She's always so excited to see me.</entry>
        <entry info="DEEPNEST_GREET">This p-place gives me the creeps. Vicious little creatures
            burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark, twisting
            maze.&lt;page&gt;Unless you're well prepared, I'd urge you to leave, though if
            you're feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy my map?</entry>
        <entry info="DEEPNEST_BOUGHT">W-w-what a horrid warren of angry beasts. It's going to
            take a whole lot of effort to climb out of this dark pit. I think I-I'll hide here a
            little longer. </entry>
        <entry info="FOG_CANYON_BOUGHT">There's a large building just below here, out in the
            middle of a lake and a marvel to observe.&lt;page&gt;I tried to head in, but it's
            become a nest for those slimey, see-through creatures.&lt;page&gt;Ugh. They're just
            so... gross, and they give a nasty shock to touch. </entry>
        <entry condition="INTRO_1">Oh, by the way, I haven't introduced myself have I? Yes,
            I should apologise for that. When you spend a lot of time by yourself, with just your
            own thoughts, you forget the niceties of conversation.</entry>
        <entry condition="NOT_ENOUGH_DP">N-not enough Geo?</entry>
        <entry condition="REFUSE_DP">N-not interested in the map?</entry>
        <entry info="OUTSKIRTS_GREET">Isn't this a cosy hole? I've been venturing about that
            wilderness beside here and thought a moment's break was well called
            for.&lt;page&gt;The landscape's all rather serene this side of the city, though the
            inhabitants are as ferocious as ever. </entry>
        <entry info="CITY_BOUGHT">We've both come far to reach this grand place. While I'm
            about these buildings, I must remember to collect a trinket or two for Iselda. </entry>
        <entry condition="REFUSE">Not interested, then? Yes, quite understandable. Exploring
            without a map, finding your own way through unknown caverns... All very nourishing for
            the soul.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps we'll meet again on our travels.</entry>
        <entry condition="INTRO_2">My name is Cornifer, and I've always loved exploring the
            world. Why, when I was first hatched I wandered off immediately, leaving my brothers and
            sisters and poor mother behind! &lt;page&gt;That's why as soon as I could I moved to
            Dirtmouth with my wife. A huge, unending Kingdom to explore right on our doorstep. Who
            could resist?&lt;page&gt;Anyway, I'll let you return to your travels. With a little
            luck, we'll meet again. Be safe and farewell!</entry>
        <entry condition="MEET_DP">Hh-hello. I'm Cornifer. I'm a m-mapper by trade.
            I've tried to chart the dense nest beneath here b-b-but it's proving too
            dangerous for a bug like me.&lt;page&gt;Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over
            the place and the passages are a dark, twisting maze. Even with my good head for
            direction, I-I-I've had enough&lt;page&gt;Unless you're well prepared, I'd

        <entry info="ROYAL_GARDENS_GREET">Have you heard of Hallownest's Queen? Apparently these
            gardens were once her retreat.&lt;page&gt;Now some vicious types are crawling all over
            the place and the plants have grown wild.&lt;page&gt;As inhospitable as it is, I've
            enjoyed my travels here. Care to see my efforts?</entry>
        <entry condition="PROMPT">Purchase a map of the area?</entry>
        <entry info="CLIFFS_BOUGHT">I chanced upon a strange bug atop these cliffs. His house
            isn't far from here. &lt;page&gt;A very imposing figure he was and no doubt lethal
            with a Nail. I suspect you two might share more in common than him and I.</entry>
        <entry info="ROYAL_GARDENS_BOUGHT">There's a Stag Station at the heart of these gardens.
            I would've taken my rest there if someone hadn't gone and locked the door. </entry>
        <entry info="GREENPATH_BOUGHT">I ran into another traveller as I made my way down here. I
            tried to call out to her as she dashed past but she barely even glanced in my direction.
            Not an appreciater of maps like you and I, obviously.</entry>
        <entry condition="MEET">Hmm? Ah, hello there. Come down to explore these beautiful old
            ruins? Don't mind me.&lt;page&gt;I've a fondness for exploring myself. Getting
            lost and finding your way again is a pleasure like no other. We're exquisitely
            lucky, you and I.&lt;page&gt;I'm a cartographer by trade, and I'm working on
            mapping this area right now. Would you like to buy a copy of my work so far?</entry>
        <entry info="WATERWAYS_GREET">Ho ho! Aren't these waterways thrilling? A labyrinth of
            pipes and tunnels.&lt;page&gt;I couldn't have asked for a better place to employ my
            talents. It's all so orderly, so considered, nothing like the crude irregularity of
            those caverns.&lt;page&gt;Ahh but so sad, my trunk is telling me those Fungal Wastes are
            close and I sense my damp adventure may have reached its end. Guess I'll be calling
            this map done.</entry>
        <entry condition="AGAIN">Hmm? Have you changed your mind about buying a map?</entry>
        <entry info="ABYSS_BOUGHT">It's a long trek back to the shop from here. I'll be
            resting my legs a little longer.&lt;page&gt;Not too long though! It won't do to have
            Iselda worrying after me.</entry>
        <entry info="CITY_GREET">Isn't this a change from those twisting natural caverns? The
            rain does cast something of a sadness upon it all but the architecture is simply
            splendid.&lt;page&gt;Charting such a different space is quite the challenge, though one
            I've eagerly undertaken.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you'd care to purchase a copy of my
            achievements so far? </entry>
        <entry info="OUTSKIRTS_BOUGHT">Judging by this wall, the city's folk seemed hesitant to
            build further into these caverns. I wonder what kept them at bay?</entry>
        <entry condition="NOT_ENOUGH">You don't have enough Geo? Ah, I understand. I'd
            give you the map as a gift, but I don't think my wife would be very happy if I did.

    <entries type="Dream_Witch">
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_8A">Yes. The time has come. The Dream Nail... And you as well,
            Wielder. It is time for you both to awaken.&lt;page&gt;The Essence you have
            collected...The hope that still remains in this old Kingdom. Pure potential! Let it
            course through you and into the Dream Nail.&lt;page&gt;Hold it aloft, Wielder! Awaken! </entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_FINAL_1">So much Essence... So bright.... You truly are the Wielder my
            tribe so long has dreamed of.&lt;page&gt;The folk of my tribe were born from a light.
            Light similar to Essence, similar to that powerful blade, though much brighter
            still.&lt;page&gt;They were content to bask in that light and honoured it... for a
            time.&lt;page&gt;But another light appeared in our world... A wyrm that took the form of
            a king.&lt;page&gt;How fickle my ancestors must have been. They forsook the light that
            spawned them. Turned their backs to it... Forgot it even.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_MEET_A">Ahhhh, you've returned. Welcome back to the waking
            world.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_5">So, you already have 700 Essence. I wonder whether the Dreamers
            are watching you as you work. Or even that old King.&lt;page&gt;That lock of theirs.
            Desperate, but very clever. I wonder how long they thought it could hold?&lt;page&gt;I
            hold no disdain for them though. As history goes on I grow numb to its
            repetitions.&lt;page&gt;Take your gift and continue collecting Essence. Once you have
            900, come back and visit me.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_7">Yes, I thought so. More than 1500 Essence. The Dream Nail is
            close... so close to fully awakening!&lt;page&gt;Continue on your path, Wielder. I know
            not what guides you, nor what will it is that drives you forward. Once you have
            collected 1800 Essence though, I will be here waiting.&lt;page&gt;Take this gift, may it
            grant you strength and help you to collect the Essence of this world!</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_4">Ahhhhh. 500 Essence. You're a master in the making. Well
            done! Well done! I've a small reward for you.&lt;page&gt;Plucked from one of my most
            precious memories, this Charm will bring you and the Dream Nail closer together still.
            The secrets of this kingdom won't be able to hide from you any
            longer!&lt;page&gt;Take it, and return once you have collected 700 Essence. More gifts
            await you...</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_GENERIC">This kingdom is full of old memories, both beautiful and
            grotesque. Seek them out, reveal them, and gather Essence.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_MEET_B">Ahhhh, you've found your way back to me. When you awoke you
            just up and left. I thought perhaps I'd frightened you.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_8B">Ahhhh, ah ha, yes...&lt;page&gt;No dream can hide itself from
            you now. You can peer into the darkest places... You just need to find the right
            crack.&lt;page&gt;What will you do with such a power, Wielder? Whose memories will you
            hunt down?&lt;page&gt;Hah. Do as you wish, my promise is fulfilled. May the crimes of my
            tribe be washed away in time, like the rest of this Kingdom's...</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_FINAL_3">Aahh... I'm sorry...&lt;page&gt;Light...
            Radiance...&lt;page&gt;I... remember you.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_INTRO">Those figures, those Dreamers... they reached out with what little
            power they still have and dragged you into that hidden place.&lt;page&gt;But that
            talisman you now wield, the Dream Nail... it can cut through the veil that separates the
            waking world from our dreams. Even the Dreamers themselves can not hide from such a
            weapon.&lt;page&gt;Though I must admit, that sacred blade has dulled over time. Together
            perhaps, we can restore its power. You only have to bring me
            Essence.&lt;page&gt;Essence... the precious fragments of light that dreams are made of.
            Collect it wherever you find it, and bring it to me. Once we have enough, we can work
            wonders together.&lt;page&gt;Go out into the world, Wielder. Hunt down the Essence that
            lingers there!&lt;page&gt;Collect 100 Essence and return to me. I will teach you
            more...</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_3">So you've collected 300 Essence... Yes, I can see the
            dreams of this old Kingdom are starting to cling to you. Very
            encouraging.&lt;page&gt;You've certainly made my dreary work here more exciting.
            Being the caretaker of this place hasn't been very stimulating.&lt;page&gt;I
            shouldn't complain though. Tending these graves and guiding the Wielder... all
            penitence for old crimes. Certain things have to be kept in balance.&lt;page&gt;Take
            this trinket for your efforts, and return with 500 Essence. Keep up your tireless
            work!</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_FINAL_2">And so this kingdom was born from that betrayal. But the
            memories of that ancient light still lingered, hush whispers of faith... Until all of
            Hallownest began to dream of that forgotten light.&lt;page&gt;Ah, but what's done is
            done. And so am I. The Wielder has at last appeared and I've held the memories of my
            tribe for long enough. It is time for us to be forgotten too.&lt;page&gt;Don't
            remember us, Wielder. Don't honour us. We do not deserve it...</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_HINT_DREAMPLANT">Essence can be found wherever dreams take
            root.&lt;page&gt;Have you seen them? Those whispering plants that grow all over this old
            Kingdom? I believe there is one just outside. Why not strike it with your Dream Nail,
            and see what happens?</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_1">Hmm, already you've collected 100 Essence. Quick work!
            Things come naturally to you, don't they?&lt;page&gt;No wonder the Dreamers tried to
            bury you in that old dream. Perhaps you frighten them? Or perhaps, being prisoners
            themselves, they desired your company?&lt;page&gt;In any case, you still have a long way
            to go. Take this old trinket as encouragement from me, and return when you have
            collected 200 Essence.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_6">The Dream Nail glows bright... It holds over 1200 Essence.
            Looking into it I can see so many memories peering back at me. So many asking to be
            remembered.&lt;page&gt;None of us can live forever, and so we ask those who survive to
            remember us.&lt;page&gt;Hold something in your mind and it lives on with you, but forget
            it and you seal it away forever. That is the only death that matters.&lt;page&gt;Huh, so
            they say! Enough of that though. Take this relic and come back to me with 1500 Essence.
            Go!</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_2A">Ahhh... Your Dream Nail holds over 200 Essence. You're
            proving your talent in its collection.&lt;page&gt;Have you seen that great door just
            outside? My tribe closed it long ago and forbade its opening.&lt;page&gt;Ah, but as far
            as I can tell I'm the only member of my tribe still breathing. That means I
            needn't feel bad about breaking a taboo. As proof of my belief in you, I'll open
            the door.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_1">Hm. You are still unpracticed in the way of dreams. Collect 100
            Essence with the Dream Nail; visit me again and I will share what little wisdom I
            have.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_3">You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still
            have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 300 Essence.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_2">You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still
            have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 200 Essence.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_5">Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail,
            haven't you? Return to me once you have collected 700 Essence and I will teach you
            more.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_4">Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail,
            haven't you? Return to me once you have collected 500 Essence and I will teach you

        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_7">Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up, return
            to me once you have collected 1500 Essence.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_6">Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up. Return
            to me once you have collected 1200 Essence.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_9">The Dream Nail has fully awoken, yet still you collect Essence.
            Perhaps I've instilled an obsession in you?&lt;page&gt;Keep at it, then! I'm
            happy to wait and watch your progress.&lt;page&gt;Once you have collected 2400 Essence,
            return to me. I've no more gifts to give... but you'd prove yourself the Wielder
            my tribe awaited.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_8">Incredible... the Dream Nail, it is so close to fully awakening!
            Collect more Essence! Once you have 1800 Essence, something truly marvellous will
            happen!</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_2B">There, the door is open and you can enter the glade beyond it.
            Listen closely in there and you may hear the utterings of bugs long gone.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_QUEST_5B">My my, you're almost starting to become a dream yourself!
            Once you have collected 900 Essence I'll teach you a trick that I've kept hidden
            for a long time...</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_GREET">Ah, Wielder, you've returned. Let me have a look at the Dream
            Nail...</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_REWARD_5B">The Dream Nail now holds 900 Essence within its core! Are you
            surprised that this old kingdom has so many hidden dreams?&lt;page&gt;Yes, you're
            starting to see them. The connections between us and the dreams we leave behind, like
            prints in the dust. The time has come for you to learn how to revisit the places
            connected to you!&lt;page&gt;Hold the Dream Nail tight, wielder, and imagine a great
            gate opening before you!</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_HINT_XERO">Sometimes dreams take the shape of those who have passed away.
            Such dreams are bountiful sources of Essence!&lt;page&gt;You should search carefully
            near graves and other monuments. Why, I believe I saw an interesting gravestone here in
            the Resting Grounds.&lt;page&gt;If you do decide to disturb those dreams though, be
            prepared for a fight...</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_DREAM1">What a terrible fate they've visited upon you.&lt;page&gt;To
            cast you away into this space between body and soul.&lt;page&gt;Will you accept their
            judgement and fade slowly away?&lt;page&gt;Or will you take the weapon before you, and
            cut your way out of this sad, forgotten dream?</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_DREAM_FALL">Though you may fall, your will shall carry you
            forward.&lt;page&gt;A dream is endless, but a Kingdom is not.&lt;page&gt;The power to
            wake this world from its slumber... you only need to reach out and take it.</entry>
        <entry info="WITCH_DREAM">What are you doing, poking about in a dusty old mind like mine?
            Nothing of worth is hidden inside, believe me.&lt;page&gt;But keep probing the world
            around you with your Dream Nail... Hidden things will reveal themselves.</entry>

        <entry condition="CROSSROADS_INFECTED">Ehhh...A sharp sickly smell has started to drift
            from the well beside town. I'd thought those depths ominous before, now they seem

            back to the village once. I don't quite understand the allure myself.&lt;page&gt;You
            can't eat them, and they don't make very good pillows. They hardly seem worth

        <entry condition="SHOPKEEP_RETURNED">Oh, what a turn! Our shopkeep's come home. Just
            wandered back in. I'd hoped for grand tales of his time below, but he seems to
            remember almost nothing! Maybe it was all too much for him?&lt;page&gt;If you're
            interested in his wares, watch out! He drives a hard bargain, that one.&lt;page&gt;No
            competition. That's the problem. It's bad for the market. Not that he's
            complaining.</entry>

        <entry condition="FLOWER_REQUEST">Hm? What's that you have there? Ah! What a
            beautiful flower!&lt;page&gt;I'd never have guessed by looking, but you have
            surprisingly good taste in flora. Why are you carrying around such an exquisite
            bloom?&lt;page&gt;Wait... you didn't...? Ahh!&lt;page&gt;This flower is... is it a
            gift? For me? Are you really giving me something so precious?</entry>
        <entry condition="INTRO_WALKEDBY">Oh! You came back! You walked straight past me, I

        <entry condition="JIJI_DOOR">Faring well in your adventures below? Well I had an
            adventure of my own while you were gone.&lt;page&gt;I don't usually visit the
            town's graveyard, but I thought I'd go and visit the grave of an old
            friend.&lt;page&gt;As I was walking amongst the tombstones, I noticed a strange kind of
            chanting coming from somewhere nearby. Extremely sinister chanting!&lt;page&gt;I looked
            around to find the source, and I saw two bright, horrible, huge eyes staring at me from
            the door of a dark cave!&lt;page&gt;I pretended I hadn't heard the voice or seen the
            eyes and scurried back to town. My friend will have to wait a little longer for her
            visit...</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAM_FLOWER">These petals... so white. Can you see them too...
            watching me from wherever you are?&lt;page&gt;Perhaps dreams aren't such bad things

        <entry condition="GENERIC_1">There's something strange about you. I've seen all
            types pass below, but you... You're almost familiar, though I'm sure we've
            never met before.</entry>
        <entry condition="KINGS_PASS">To reach Dirtmouth, most travellers take circuitous routes
            around the cliffs beside us. It's a hard trek now but in the kingdom's prime
            things were far simpler.&lt;page&gt;There's an old pass in the cliffs that once
            allowed easy access. The bridge up to it has long since crumbled away, and even without
            it, a huge door bars entry.&lt;page&gt;I can't complain mind you. It's meant
            we've only ever had to accommodate a trickle of travellers, even during our busiest
            times.&lt;page&gt;I wouldn't want hordes of bugs to descend on Dirtmouth. I like the
            quiet.</entry>
        <entry condition="GOSSIP_HINT">It's a sprawling land beneath us. If you're ever
            feeling lost or would care for some direction, come speak with me. I may be able to
            suggest a new sight or a new path you'd never before
            considered.&lt;page&gt;Suprised? Despite my lack of experience, I'm actually quite
            knowledgeable about the lay of the kingdom below. I've listened to countless stories
            from travellers and explorers just like yourself.&lt;page&gt;I'm sure you'll
            have your own grand tale to tell once you're finished down there. Either that or
            you'll be dead! I'll admit, in Hallownest, the latter is far more
            common.</entry>
        <entry condition="HINT_ANCIENT_BASIN">Did you know the caverns continue even below the
            capital? Few have ventured that deep so the details are scant.&lt;page&gt;Those who made
            it back told of impossibly old structures and roads formed as though the rock itself
            possessed a will.</entry>
        <entry condition="INTRO_VISITEDCROSSROAD">Oh! You're back! You walked straight past
            me and descended down into the ruins without even saying hello! I thought maybe I'd
            seen a ghost.&lt;page&gt;The mind sometimes plays tricks on you when you spend a lot of
            time alone.</entry>
        <entry condition="STAG_STATION_REOPENED">I never thought I'd see such a thing. The
            Stag Station has opened! That building lay silent since before even my
            time.&lt;page&gt;Oh, I've heard the tales of the glorious lines. A web of tunnels
            running all through the kingdom. Not that I'll be travelling them, mind
            you!&lt;page&gt;I'm quite content where I am.</entry>
        <entry condition="HINT_CRYSTAL_PEAK">Did you see that tall cliff beyond the town's
            graveyard? That's only the base of a much larger peak.&lt;page&gt;There's mines
            and machinery and all sorts of valuable rock forms inside. Many a traveller through
            Dirtmouth headed straight for it.</entry>
        <entry condition="BLACK_EGG_OPENED">I heard a piercing cry from the well. It echoed
            about my mind and left me all a daze.&lt;page&gt;I'd say it was a foul beast's
            death, but this cry sounded different...divine? Has something happened little
            traveller?&lt;page&gt;No. Don't tell me. If foul events are brewing, it's
            probably better I don't know.</entry>
        <entry condition="INTRO_NORMAL">Ho there, traveller. I'm afraid there's only me
            left to offer welcome. Our town's fallen quiet you see.</entry>
        <entry condition="GENERIC_2">Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you
            it's quite comfortable. There's no better place to collect your thoughts before
            heading below. &lt;page&gt;Plus I enjoy the company. Not that you seem the talkative
            sort.</entry>
        <entry condition="DUNG">Can you... smell something? There's suddenly a horrid stench
            in the air.&lt;page&gt;I swear, the town usually smells much nicer than this. Please
            accept my humble apology!</entry>
        <entry condition="FLOWER_ACCEPT">Ah! I can really have it? My, my... I barely know what
            to say except... thank you!&lt;page&gt;I'd resigned myself to selflessly giving out
            advice to passers by, without receiving any gratitude in return. Little did I know, one
            young bug was taking my words to heart and would repay my kindness.&lt;page&gt;And with
            such a beautiful gift! Ahh. Suddenly, the world seems a little less
            faded.&lt;page&gt;Thank you, my friend. I will take care of this flower while you're
            gone, so we can enjoy it together when you return.</entry>
        <entry condition="HINT_FUNGAL_WASTES">My understanding of Hallownest can be a little
            vague, but below those leafy caverns is a fungal grove, once home to peaceful creatures
            not quite bug and not quite plant.&lt;page&gt;Sounds almost worth a visit no? Well
            there's a downside, the dreadful stench! A noxious odour fills the place. </entry>
        <entry condition="HISTORY_2">I hope you aren't too disappointed by our little town,
            traveller. Though it's now a solemn place, once we were much more
            welcoming.&lt;page&gt;Entry to the kingdom was forbidden long ago, supposedly after some
            great calamity. Many gates were closed, but our old well remains as a way to creep back
            in.&lt;page&gt;Over the years, all kinds used the well to wriggle into the ruins,
            wanderers, thieves, adventurers.&lt;page&gt;Funny how few ever come back up. Perhaps
            they find what they're looking for?..&lt;page&gt;Bah, I'm not so naive. No
            doubt, they've all been gobbled up! There are countless dangers in those
            depths.</entry>
        <entry condition="HISTORY_1">Many used to come, hoping the kingdom would fulfill their
            desires. &lt;page&gt;Hallownest, it was once called. Supposedly the greatest kingdom
            there ever was, full of treasures and secrets.&lt;page&gt;Hm. Now it's nothing more
            than a poisonous tomb full of monsters and madness.&lt;page&gt;Everything fades
            eventually, I suppose.</entry>
        <entry condition="HINT_GREENPATH">I used to think the kingdom below was all dead cold
            rock, but I've since been told different. Travellers speak of startling variety in
            Hallownest's caverns. Even just besides those Crossroads there's meant to be an
            area filled with leafy greenery.&lt;page&gt;I told those same travellers about the
            wonderful grasses that grow around the town. They didn't seem impressed. </entry>
        <entry condition="FLOWER_DECLINE">Oh. My mistake. Yes. Very foolish of me. I don't
            know why I thought you'd go to so much effort for a simple old
            bug.&lt;page&gt;Appreciating others and being considerate... these aren't skills
            that everyone is born with.</entry>
        <entry condition="FLOWER_GENERIC">This flower you gave me... when dark thoughts creep
            into my head I gaze at it and think of you.&lt;page&gt;Why not rest at the bench here
            for a while? We can enjoy the flower together before you head off again.</entry>
        <entry condition="BRETTA_RETURNED">That lovely young lass returned to us!&lt;page&gt;I
            must admit, I'd placed thin odds on her survival.&lt;page&gt;Seems to think very
            highly of her rescuer, some sort of dashing, warrior type. Barely stopped gushing since
            she got back.&lt;page&gt;The warrior must have passed down below whilst I was taking my
            nap. Such a shame. I'd have loved to meet so impressive a bug.</entry>
        <entry condition="INTRO_MAIN">The other residents, they've all disappeared. Headed
            down that well, one by one, into the caverns below.&lt;page&gt;Used to be there was a
            great kingdom beneath our town. It's long fell to ruin, yet it still draws folks
            into its depths.&lt;page&gt;Wealth, glory, enlightenment, that darkness seems to promise
            all things. I'm sure you too seek your dreams down there.&lt;page&gt;Well watch out.
            It's a sickly air that fills the place. Creatures turn mad and travellers are robbed
            of their memories.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps dreams aren't such great things after
            all...</entry>
        <entry condition="HINT_CITY_OF_TEARS">Hallownest's great capital is what most of you
            brave types come to see. Thinking to loot its treasures I suppose? It must be brimming
            with them.&lt;page&gt;The city's right at the centre of the kingdom, though I've
            heard the gates are sealed, so gaining entry can be difficult.&lt;page&gt;It'd be a
            rich bug that could return with even a fraction of the wealth inside. Despite my age,
            I've only seen few who've managed it. Must say something of the dangers about
            its streets.</entry>
        <entry condition="TOWN_GREET_4">If you do meet my fellows down there you might remind
            them of their poor Elder, up here, back aching, abandoned to his lonesome vigil. Poor
            poor me!...&lt;page&gt;Oh I'm fine, really, but a bit of guilt might go some way in
            persuading their return. Assuming they're still alive that is.</entry>
        <entry condition="FLOWER_REREQUEST">You're still holding onto that exquisite
            bloom... have you changed your mind? Are you really giving me something so
            precious?</entry>
        <entry condition="MAP_SHOP_OPEN">A young couple's just recently taken up residence
            in the house beside the station. Seems they're running a map shop, which may excite
            adventurous types like yourself.&lt;page&gt;She's a tall bug, the wife. I told them
            to take a larger house, especially given they're all empty, but they liked the look
            of that one.&lt;page&gt;The way she has to bend just to get through the door...I
            wouldn't put up with it myself.</entry>
        <entry condition="TEMPLE_VISITED">Did you visit that temple? A strange building I've
            heard, though I'd never dare the journey myself.&lt;page&gt;The braver among us once
            went there to pray, said they felt at peace within the walls. After a while, they
            stopped going. I wonder what changed?</entry>
        <entry condition="HINT_RESTING_GROUNDS">Apparently, the many graves of Hallownest are
            enough to fill an entire network of caverns. Somewhere above the city it's told.
            Sounds a gloomy sight.&lt;page&gt;Bah, I'm content with our own humble plot. In our
            boom times, we even had a gravedigger! Not a bad sort he was, though dead
            now.&lt;page&gt;He, didn't die to the dangers of Hallownest mind you. That one fell
            into an open grave and couldn't climb out.&lt;page&gt;I found the corpse myself.
            Dreadful nuisance. I've since had to tend the graves myself.</entry>
        <entry condition="TOWN_GREET_3">Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you
            it’s quite comfortable. There's no better place to collect your thoughts before
            heading below.&lt;page&gt;Plus, I'd enjoy the company, even if you're not the
            most talkative sort.</entry>

            be dealing with, but what a surprise! He's headed down below.&lt;page&gt;He'll
            pop back occasionally to deliver new maps for the store but I do wish he'd spend a
            little more time up here. I've not much interest in retail myself.&lt;page&gt;Now,
            let's see what's here for me to sell.</entry>
        <entry condition="REPEAT">Are you enjoying yourself down in the ruins? At times my husband

        <entry condition="NEW_MAP">ISELDA_NEW_MAP</entry>
        <entry condition="GREET1">Of all the places to end up, we've picked this dreary town.
            I'd thought it a temporary stop, then my husband became obsessed with that old
            ruin.&lt;page&gt;Now he's spending all his time down there. He argues cartography is
            sound business, but other than you, who's buying?</entry>
        <entry condition="CORNIFER_HOME">Cornifer's home at last, but look at him, he's
            exhausted. He always does this, furiously charts a place, then collapses once he's
            done.&lt;page&gt;He'll be sleeping for some time I imagine, so even with him home,
            I'm still lost for company.&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, but I do love the bug, even his faults.
            Seeing his passion for maps, it's something of an inspiration.&lt;page&gt;Corny
            keeps asking me to join him on his adventures and I've always declined. Maybe next
            time I should accept the offer?</entry>
        <entry condition="NOSTOCK">After more supplies? You've already bought so much.
            Unfortunately for now, you've cleaned us out of anything worth
            selling.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer will no doubt be pleased, though I do wonder what he plans
            to spend all that Geo on. </entry>
        <entry condition="GHOSTPIN">Corny was telling me of some distinctive graves and shrines
            about the kingdom. I've made a new pin to represent them.&lt;page&gt;This one was
            quite challenging to make, and I laboured over the details. It's a nice result so I
            think it's worth a little more.</entry>
        <entry condition="TRAMPIN">Apparently Hallownest has giant metal carriages called trams?
            Sounds unecessary to me, given those old stag lines that Corny always talks
            about.&lt;page&gt;Still, I've made a pin to represent a tram station. Might be
            useful if you're inclined to make your map more detailed.&lt;page&gt;It wasn't
            too hard to make, so I'm not charging a premium for it.</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAMTREE">My husband mentioned some strange roots that grow about the
            kingdom and suggested I make a pin to mark them.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer thinks my pin's
            depiction look grander than the sad limp thing he comes across, but I figure, that's
            not a bad thing. Who'd want to buy a pin of a limp root?</entry>

            much.&lt;page&gt;He was always aloof, but... not unkind. When we last spoke, he said he

            skilled enough in the Nail Arts to earn his highest esteem.&lt;page&gt;I do not begrudge
            you his love. You have earned it.&lt;page&gt;And perhaps by helping you along your path,
            I have redeemed myself... if only a little.</entry>
        <entry info="ORO_MEET">Hmph. How did you find me, down here where the world
            ends?&lt;page&gt;Yes, I know why you're here. You came to learn a Nail Art from the
            legendary Nailmaster Oro.&lt;page&gt;It is the law of the Great Nailsage that I must
            pass down my teachings to those who are worthy.&lt;page&gt;But no law forbids me from
            exacting a payment for my time. If you truly wish to train under me, prove it with
            Geo!</entry>
        <entry info="SHEO_DREAM">My brother, Oro... what drove you to hide away deep down at the
            very edge of that ash swept grave?&lt;page&gt;Was it pride, or fear, or shame? Perhaps
            you should lay down your nail if it haunts you so, and find a new calling that eases
            your soul.</entry>
        <entry info="SHEO_ART">Something about your bearing... I feel as though you haven't yet
            abandoned the way of the nail. I can teach you something, if you like... </entry>
        <entry info="MATO_MEET">Hm? Ah, well met! Yes, I thought I could sense the aura of a fierce
            warrior approaching.&lt;page&gt;I'm impressed you found my sanctuary here at the top
            of the world. No doubt you've endured many trials and overcome many foes in your
            quest to find me.&lt;page&gt;No, don't speak a word. I, Nailmaster Mato, who was
            taught the Art of the Nail by the Great Nailsage himself, hereby accept you as my pupil!
            Let us begin the lesson immediately!</entry>
        <entry info="SHEO_REFUSE">Oh? Have you, too, grown weary of the weight of a nail? I
            understand. Stay, if you like, and we can make art together.</entry>
        <entry info="SHEO_MEET">A visitor! Why have you crept in here, little grub? Perhaps, like
            me, you have a taste for discovering new things?&lt;page&gt;I am Sheo, and in a previous
            life I was a Nailmaster. Yes, the only thing that drove me was becoming stronger and
            honing my skills with a nail.&lt;page&gt;I imagined it was my one calling in life, but
            that feeling faded over time. Now I seek a new calling, something that speaks to my soul
            and compels me forward.&lt;page&gt;That's why I spend my time here, secluded, trying
            to master the art of creation. Painting, sculpting... these things bring a different
            kind of pleasure.&lt;page&gt;Mmm. You don't seem very moved by what I've said.
            Was it Sheo the Nailmaster you were looking for? Did you come to learn a Nail Art?
            I'll teach you if you insist...</entry>
        <entry info="MATO_TAUGHT">Your form... exquisite! Now I know how my own master felt when he
            passed down his teachings to us.&lt;page&gt;I hope you don't think me too forward
            when I say that I consider you to be my child. Yes! When I saw you perform my Nail Art I
            felt a bond between us suddenly flash into existence!&lt;page&gt;You honour me beyond
            words, my pupil...&lt;page&gt;Thank you.</entry>
        <entry info="SHEO_ORO">So you met my brother Oro and convinced him to teach you his Nail
            Art. Hmm.&lt;page&gt;It's been a long time since I've seen him. I wonder how
            much he's changed. He always seemed to be haunted by something, though I never
            learned what.&lt;page&gt;No matter the distance between us though, we are still
            brothers. I hope that passing down his learnings to you brought him some
            happiness.</entry>

            the wielding of a brush... these things are not so different.&lt;page&gt;We cut into the

            their honour, though also their lethal traditions.&lt;page&gt;I've some words of
            advice, my friend. If you plan to challenge the lords of this tribe, your blunted nail
            may prove inadequate.&lt;page&gt;There is a city nearby, the old capital of Hallownest.

        <entry condition="SPA">Hello, hello! What a thrill this is, to find such warm comfort
            amidst the den of beasts.&lt;page&gt;This is a ferocious place no doubt. Supposedly,
            there's a village deep in the warren. Its inhabitants never accepted
            Hallownest's King.</entry>
        <entry condition="QUEENSTATION_01">Isn't this something. I'd not expected to
            discover so huge a Stag Station after that foggy descent.&lt;page&gt;The bugs of

            the feat, though in my own travels I've not come across one.&lt;page&gt;I'd
            heard it told the Kingdom's moths did delve amongst dreams and the dead. Perhaps

        <entry condition="RUINS_1">The capital lies before us my friend. What a sombre place it

            descend.&lt;page&gt;Is it fear I wonder, or something else that holds me back? </entry>
        <entry condition="RUINS_2">The city looks to be built into an enormous cavern, and the
            rain pours down from cracks in the stone above.&lt;page&gt;There must be a lot of water
            up there somewhere. I suppose, if the cave roof stayed strong this long, it should hold
            for us.&lt;page&gt;Before I leave this Kingdom, I'd like to see where all that water
            comes from. What a sight it must be!</entry>
        <entry condition="RUINS_3">If you look down from here, through the rain, you can just
            make out those twisted sentries, their husks still stuck in endless

            what..&lt;page&gt;I'd thought it my lust for discovery that led me here but now
            there seems something else.&lt;page&gt;This building beckons me.</entry>
        <entry condition="TEMPLE_4">To persevere in this ruin, that old nail alone just won't
            be enough. Though that's no problem! One only has to look around.&lt;page&gt;Plenty
            have come before us and most have met their grisly end, many more equipped than you and
            I.&lt;page&gt;I'm sure they wouldn't mind were a fellow explorer to relieve them
            of their tools. It's a kindness really. The dead shouldn't be burdened with such
            things.</entry>

            survived the trek through these shimmering caverns.&lt;page&gt;There's an air of
            strength about you. I suspect it would be quite intimidating, if not for your small
            stature.</entry>
        <entry condition="MINES_2">Did it sadden you to see those miners below, still labouring
            at their endless task?&lt;page&gt;Even overcome, strong purpose has been imprinted upon
            their husks.&lt;page&gt;The crystal ore is said to contain a sort of energy, not as
            powerful as the soul the city dwellers harnessed but far less
            lethal.&lt;page&gt;...Strange to know such ancient facts. I wonder from where my

        <entry info="RELICDEALER_IDOL_5">A King's Idol?&lt;page&gt;With as many of these as
            you've delivered, the other Relic Seekers are like to think I've gone mad for
            the King!&lt;page&gt;Pah! Who am I kidding. They'll only be jealous of my
            collection. Find me more!</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_IDOL_4">A King's Idol?&lt;page&gt;I've often wondered the
            true visage of the king. Depictions are of an imposing, gleaming figure and a fiercely
            horned crown.&lt;page&gt;I suspect there's much embellishment in the imagery though.
            A ruler seeking worship tends to hide their blemishes. It'd do no good to appear a
            common bug.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_3">A Wanderer's Journal? Yes. Yes. I'll add it to
            the pile with the others.&lt;page&gt;I don't know when I'll get to decipher this
            one. It's long hard work translating the many languages of the bugs that explore
            these caverns.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_2">Another Wanderer's Journal?&lt;page&gt;I might not
            offer a lot for each but they're plentiful about the caverns and I doubt you'll

        <entry info="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_5">Another Wanderer's Journal, eh?&lt;page&gt;This
            journal is of traditional stone type. Text endures well upon it.&lt;page&gt;In its
            declining age, this city switched from stone to parchment woven of spider's
            silk.&lt;page&gt;It's a small tragedy, but the moisture in these towers has rendered
            most of those texts illegible. </entry>

        <entry info="RELICDEALER_IDOL_1">A King's Idol, eh?&lt;page&gt;Hallownest's king was
            an elusive figure, deified by the citizens. With the king rarely seen, worship was
            offered through these idols.&lt;page&gt;There's an expert craft to them. Few alive
            could match this skill.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_SEAL_1">A Hallownest Seal, eh? Very interesting this.&lt;page&gt;Do
            you know of the Kingdom's five great knights? They're revered figures of
            Hallownest, often mentioned in the annals of the Kingdom, but only as a
            group.&lt;page&gt;Both their names and appearance seem to have been expunged from
            history.&lt;page&gt;So long has passed since their time. It'd be a grand achievement
            to discover their identities.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_IDOL_3">Another King's Idol?&lt;page&gt;Have you visited the
            remnants of his palace? It's down below this city, in the bedrock of the
            kingdom.&lt;page&gt;Must've been an impressive sight in its time. Now there's
            nothing left.&lt;page&gt;It's a strange thing though. There are no signs of conflict
            around the area. It's as though the whole place just vanished. </entry>

            squatter.&lt;page&gt;This place was dead empty when I moved in and there's no one
            left alive who'd lay claim to the tower.&lt;page&gt;If you fancy yourself a domicile
            in the city, go find somewhere else, preferably in another building.&lt;page&gt;I'm
            well content with just my relics. I'm not after neighbours.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_SEAL_4">Another Hallownest Seal?&lt;page&gt;Others have told me
            there's a statue out by the city's entrance depicting a large knightly figure.
            Could be one of the Kingdom's great five.&lt;page&gt;I'd have looked it over
            myself, but the gate's long been shut tight and it's too much hassle taking the
            long way round with all those blasted husks about.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN">Oh? What are you doing out in this miserable
            downpour?&lt;page&gt;Impressive fountain isn't it? I'm sure we'd be able to
            appreciate it more if we weren't both getting drenched.&lt;page&gt;That knight up
            there was an important one. The plaque here mentions its 'sacrifice,' which
            carries something of an ominous tone.&lt;page&gt;Probably met some sort of horrible end,
            though it sounds like the knight's goal may have been achieved in the
            process&lt;page&gt;In all the relics I've collected, I've yet to find a clue as
            to what that was.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_SEAL_2">Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over.&lt;page&gt;Ah. I
            enjoy collecting their like, but there's little information to be gleaned of
            each.&lt;page&gt;Mind you, they do keep a nice shine about them and there's nothing
            wrong with appreciating something purely on aesthetic merits.</entry>
        <entry info="RELICDEALER_NAILSMITH">That nail you bear looks mighty blunt. There're
            cracks all through it. It's as much a relic as the objects in my

            hunt down that old Nailsmith.&lt;page&gt;His hut's on the outskirts of the city. Not
            that far from here. He might help add some sting to your weapon, provided he's
            feeling generous. </entry>

        <entry info="RELICDEALER_EGG_4">A fourth Arcane Egg! I wouldn't have believed it
            possible. I've never met a bug with your knack for uncovering this Kingdom's
            treasures.&lt;page&gt;You must have some sort of sense about you? Or maybe these eggs
            are somehow drawn to you.&lt;page&gt;My fellows have claimed there's a will of sorts
            within each egg, that each seeks its own bearer, or reject them.&lt;page&gt;That'd
            be a subtle power indeed, and I remain sceptical. Relic Seekers are prone to confusing
            facts with fable.</entry>

            Hallownest, but they're not the only remnant of that age.&lt;page&gt;You may have
            come upon them, those old statues that seem a store for soul? They too prove its

            still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... </entry>
        <entry condition="BASEMENT_REPEAT">Off you go Nailmaster. I've nothing more to give
            you...&lt;page&gt;Nothing for free at least. I'll be up briefly and eager take your
            Geo in trade for my precious wares.</entry>
        <entry condition="NOSTOCK_1">Ah, still looking for something to buy? Is your Geo weighing you
            down? Unfortunately, you seem to have cleared out everything I'd be willing to part
            with. Nothing left at all!&lt;page&gt;I think there might be a few old trinkets down in
            my storeroom, but I lost the key a while ago.&lt;page&gt;So, no more business between us
            I'm afraid! For now at least. Get out of here and let me spend some quality time
            with all the Geo you've gifted me.</entry>

        <entry condition="CROSSROADS">It was a long time ago, but I remember when these highways and
            crossroads pulsed with life. These are the paths I first carried passengers through when
            I was young.&lt;page&gt;Those travellers are long gone, yet still I remain. Now it seems
            it's just you and I and the furtive creatures scratching and squirming all around
            us.</entry>
        <entry condition="ROYALGARDENS">Before you rang the bell, I'd almost forgotten this
            station existed. It was not often used by the common bugs, being a well-guarded retreat
            for our late Queen.&lt;page&gt;Even as overgrown as they've become, these gardens
            are still beautiful after all this time. I'm sure the Queen would be happy to know
            that.</entry>
        <entry condition="DEEPNEST">Ahh, little one... Where are we? I have never been to this
            station. It has a strange air of danger to it. Let me take you somewhere safer,
            quickly.</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAM">I tire so easily now, and my old legs seem to ache more and more.
            Still, I'm lucky to grow old at all... so many others haven't.</entry>
        <entry condition="FLOWER_WARNING">That flower you're carrying... It looks quite
            beautiful, but also very delicate. I fear if you travel with me it will be
            ruined.&lt;page&gt;If you need to keep it intact, I'd suggest using your own legs to
            carry it to its destination.</entry>
        <entry condition="TISO">I see another takes rest upon the bench. There's something
            unpleasant about that one, but a stag station's doors are open to all.&lt;page&gt;If
            he requests passage, I'll offer it gladly. My duty as a stag far outweighs any
            personal distaste. </entry>
        <entry condition="NEST">Being back in my old home... I feel the weight of my long life
            bearing down on me.&lt;page&gt;I carry it proudly, though. Wherever I travel, the
            memories of my family and my kind come with me.</entry>
        <entry condition="TOWN">This place... we are near the surface, I believe? There is a town
            here. You should take the opportunity to rest.&lt;page&gt;This place was once full of
            travellers coming and going. It seems much quieter now.</entry>
        <entry condition="TRAM">That pass you hold! Is it not for that ghastly machine, the tram? I
            hope you're not thinking of riding on that grotesque contraption.&lt;page&gt;The
            thought a mere machine could attempt what we stags do! Foolish...Very foolish.</entry>
        <entry condition="HOPE_1">What do you think of my old home, little one?&lt;page&gt;It was
            full of life, once. Stags coming and going, swapping stories of the places they'd
            been and the passengers they'd met.&lt;page&gt;For a long time now, I've
            considered myself the only one remaining. The last stag.&lt;page&gt;But being in the
            Nest again... there's something in the air. A smell, or a warmth, or a presence
            perhaps?&lt;page&gt;Could it be, other stags have made their way out into the wider
            world?</entry>
        <entry condition="REMEMBER_3">Little one! I've found it! The Stag Nest, where I was born
            and raised.&lt;page&gt;I've yet to go there again. My duty binds me to travel only
            where I am called, but if you wished to see it yourself, I could take you
            there.&lt;page&gt;None may remain to welcome us, but the nest is still a sight to
            behold! Give me the word, and we will go there at once.</entry>
        <entry condition="REMEMBER_2">Ahh, many stag stations have been opened. Again I can travel
            the breadth of the kingdom. So many grand thoroughfares and old sideways I'd
            forgotten.&lt;page&gt;Somewhere amongst the lines lies the Stag Nest, the place where I
            was born and raised. I'd thought its location lost to my failing mind, but now I can
            almost remember the path.&lt;page&gt;If you keep opening stag stations and beckoning me
            through them, perhaps I'll again find that Nest. Ahh, I would like that very
            much!</entry>
        <entry condition="HOPE_2">Yes, I will hold onto that hope. My kin, still alive, still out
            there, journeying beyond these lands.&lt;page&gt;But for me, I could never abandon the
            stagways. Not as long as passengers still need them.&lt;page&gt;I can tell you still
            have important work to do. I will be your companion as long as my old body still
            serves.&lt;page&gt;Let us enjoy the old stagways of this kingdom together a little
            longer.</entry>
        <entry condition="RUINS2">Little one, we stand in the King's Station! Named of course
            for the King of Hallownest, he who ordered the building of the stagways and
            stations.&lt;page&gt;The King never rode the stagways himself, but I've heard he was
            a glorious bug to behold, bright and radiant in visage, so much so it hurt to look at
            him.</entry>
        <entry condition="TRAVEL_1">Ready to go, little one?</entry>
        <entry condition="END_SPEAK">Eager to travel the stagways? Just hop upon that platform, give
            me the signal and we'll soon be on our way.</entry>
        <entry condition="HIDDEN">Ah! What station is this, hidden all the way at the bottom of the
            world?&lt;page&gt;Until I heard the bell calling, I didn't even know the Stagways
            travelled so deep. You've discovered something quite astounding, little
            one!&lt;page&gt;No matter how old I grow, the world still keeps surprises like this
            stowed away...</entry>
        <entry condition="MEET">Greetings, little one! It's been an age since I last heard the
            ringing of a station bell. It echoed down the stagways and called me to
            you.&lt;page&gt;I've grown stiff and tired over these many years and I've
            forgotten much, but the sound of the bell will always call me back.&lt;page&gt;These
            stagways stretch the depths of Hallownest. If you want to travel them, hail me from the
            platform. I will take you where you need to go.</entry>
        <entry condition="RESTINGGROUNDS">The Resting Grounds... Passengers would come here to
            conduct rituals for those who had passed on.&lt;page&gt;Not any more though. Perhaps the
            dead conduct their own rituals now?</entry>
        <entry condition="REMEMBER_1">You've opened several stag stations now, haven't you?
            I'm thankful for the opportunity to once more travel through the
            kingdom.&lt;page&gt;As I visit more places I feel my memories returning to me, like the
            stagways of my mind are running once more.&lt;page&gt;Continue to open the stations and
            you'll have my deepest gratitude.</entry>
        <entry condition="EGG_INSPECT">An empty eggshell.</entry>
        <entry condition="FUNGUS">Ahh, this gladdens me. The Queen's Station has opened once
            more. This place was a bustling hub of travel, well-placed for travellers visiting the
            outer edges of the land.&lt;page&gt;You're quite the explorer to find this
            place.</entry>
        <entry condition="RUINS1">I remember this station well. A common trip it was. Goods from all
            over the kingdom were transported here.&lt;page&gt;Not a lot was sent back the other way
            though.</entry>
        <entry condition="GREENPATH">My, this place is much changed since I last saw it. The
            greenery grows so wild the station's like to be consumed by it.</entry>

        <entry info="PRECEPT_29">Precept Twenty-Nine: 'Develop Your Sense of
            Direction'.&lt;page&gt;It's easy to get lost when travelling through winding,
            twisting caverns. Having a good sense of direction is like having a magical map inside
            of your head. Very useful.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_39">Precept Thirty-Nine: 'Eat Quickly and Drink
            Slowly'.&lt;page&gt;Your body is a delicate thing and you must fuel it with great
            deliberation. Food must go in as fast as possible, but fluids at a slower rate.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_19">Precept Nineteen: 'If You Try, Succeed'.&lt;page&gt;If
            you're going to attempt something, make sure you achieve it. If you do not succeed,
            then you have actually failed! Avoid this at all costs.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_9">Precept Nine: 'Keep Your Home Tidy'.&lt;page&gt;Your home is
            where you keep your most prized possession - yourself. Therefore, you should make an
            effort to keep it nice and clean.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_57">Precept Fifty-Seven: 'Obey All Precepts'.&lt;page&gt;Most
            importantly, you must commit all of these precepts to memory and obey them all
            unfailingly. Including this one!&lt;page&gt;Hmm. Have you truly listened to everything
            I've said? Let's start again and repeat the 'Fifty-Seven Precepts of
            Zote'.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_7">Precept Seven: 'Mourn Not the Dead'.&lt;page&gt;When we die,
            do things get better for us or worse? There's no way to tell, so we shouldn't
            bother mourning. Or celebrating for that matter.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_4">Precept Four: 'Forget Your Past'.&lt;page&gt;The past is
            painful, and thinking about your past can only bring you misery. Think about something
            else instead, such as the future, or some food.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_5">Precept Five: 'Strength Beats Strength'.&lt;page&gt;Is your
            opponent strong? No matter! Simply overcome their strength with even more strength, and
            they'll soon be defeated.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_2">Precept Two: 'Never Let Them Laugh at You'.&lt;page&gt;Fools
            laugh at everything, even at their superiors. But beware, laughter isn't harmless!
            Laughter spreads like a disease, and soon everyone is laughing at you.&lt;page&gt;You
            need to strike at the source of this perverse merriment quickly to stop it from
            spreading.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_3">Precept Three: 'Always Be Rested'.&lt;page&gt;Fighting and
            adventuring take their toll on your body. When you rest, your body strengthens and
            repairs itself. The longer you rest, the stronger you become.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_43">Precept Forty-Three: 'Never Forgive'.&lt;page&gt;If someone
            asks forgiveness of you, for instance a brother of yours, always deny it. That brother,
            or whoever it is, doesn't deserve such a thing.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_53">Precept Fifty-Three: 'Do Not Steal the Desires of
            Others'.&lt;page&gt;Every creature keeps their desires locked up inside of
            themselves. If you catch a glimpse of another's desires, resist the urge to claim
            them as your own. It will not lead you to happiness.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_23">Precept Twenty-Three: 'Identify the Foe's Weak
            Point'.&lt;page&gt;Every foe you encounter has a weak point, such as a crack in
            their shell or being asleep. You must constantly be alert and scrutinising your enemy to
            detect their weakness!</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_33">Precept Thirty-Three: 'Show the Enemy No
            Respect'.&lt;page&gt;Being gallant to your enemies is no virtue! If someone opposes
            you, they don't deserve respect or kindness or mercy.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_13">Precept Thirteen: 'Never Be Afraid'.&lt;page&gt;Fear can
            only hold you back. Facing your fears can be a tremendous effort. Therefore, you should
            just not be afraid in the first place.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_37">Precept Thirty-Seven: 'Borrow, But Do Not
            Lend'.&lt;page&gt;If you lend and are repayed, you gain nothing. If you borrow but
            do not repay, you gain everything.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_17">Precept Seventeen: 'Believe In Your
            Strength'.&lt;page&gt;Others may doubt you, but there's someone you can always
            trust. Yourself. Make sure to believe in your own strength, and you will never
            falter.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_34">Precept Thirty-Four: 'Don't Eat Immediately Before
            Sleeping'.&lt;page&gt;This can cause restlessness and indigestion. It's just
            common sense.</entry>
        <entry condition="COLOSSEUM_REPEAT">Leave me be, you lowly worm! I must rest before my great
            battle. Pray we do not meet in the arena...</entry>
        <entry condition="COLOSSEUM_MEET">Hmm? What do you want, cur? Have you come to laugh at me
            as well?&lt;page&gt;Fools! Did you never consider that being trapped in this cage was
            precisely what I intended?!&lt;page&gt;Yes, by all means, release me into your
            arena!&lt;page&gt;I am Zote the Mighty! And as soon as I draw my nail, 'Life
            Ender', your laughter will turn into terror!</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAM_COLOSSEUM">How miserable, to be stuck here instead of continuing my
            quest...&lt;page&gt;I came to this kingdom to fulfill a promise... and that is what I

            possible.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_8">Precept Eight: 'Travel Alone'.&lt;page&gt;You can rely on
            nobody, and nobody will always be loyal. Therefore, nobody should be your constant
            companion.</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAM_BUZZER">Foolish beast... you dulled your mandibles by gnawing on my
            indestructible body. No wonder you were defeated by this weakling!</entry>

            don't want you splashing me. I've had a miserable time trying to keep
            dry.&lt;page&gt;I am Zote the Mighty, a knight of great renown. If I decide that I'm
            going to stay dry, then that's what's going to happen!&lt;page&gt;Curse this
            wretched city! Water and monsters constantly fall from above! It's no wonder this

            renown. Cross me again, and you'll find out why they call my weapon 'Life
            Ender'.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_56">Precept Fifty-Six: 'Do Not Dream'.&lt;page&gt;Dreams are
            dangerous things. Strange ideas, not your own, can worm their way into your mind. But if
            you resist those ideas, sickness will wrack your body! Best not to dream at all, like
            me.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_26">Precept Twenty-Six: 'Don't Trust Your
            Reflection'.&lt;page&gt;When peering at certain shining surfaces, you may see a copy
            of your own face. The face will mimic your movements and seems similar to your own, but
            I don't think it can be trusted.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_36">Precept Thirty-Six: 'Eggshells are
            brittle'.&lt;page&gt;Once again, this precept explains itself.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_16">Precept Sixteen: 'Don't Hesitate'.&lt;page&gt;Once
            you've made a decision, carry it out and don't look back. You'll achieve
            much more this way.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_46">Precept Forty-Six: 'The World is Smaller Than You
            Think'.&lt;page&gt;When young, you tend to think that the world is vast, huge,
            gigantic. It's only natural. Unfortunately, it's actually quite a lot smaller
            than that. I can say this, now having travelled everywhere in the land.</entry>
        <entry condition="TOWN_2">That daft old fellow over there... He keeps talking absolute
            drivel. Seems to think the very air is deadly down in the caverns. Perhaps he should
            consider not breathing.&lt;page&gt;He keeps talking about dreams, too. Pfah! Dreams are
            for those too feeble to truly live.</entry>
        <entry condition="TOWN_1">You there! Why are you skulking about in the
            shadows?&lt;page&gt;Yes, your eyes do not deceive you. I am Zote the Mighty, a knight of
            great renown. Tremble before me!&lt;page&gt;While you were hiding here in your dingy
            little village, I ventured into the dark pit below us and slew a great beast. It had
            sharp mandibles and atrocious manners.&lt;page&gt;Yes, yes. All glory to me. But I
            don't have time for your adulation! I must rest and prepare for my next journey
            down.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_44">Precept Forty-Four: 'You Can Not Breathe
            Water'.&lt;page&gt;Water is refreshing, but if you try to breathe it you are in for
            a nasty shock.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_54">Precept Fifty-Four: 'If You Lock Something Away, Keep the
            Key'.&lt;page&gt;Nothing should be locked away for ever, so hold onto your keys. You
            will eventually return and unlock everything you hid away.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_24">Precept Twenty-Four: 'Strike the Foe's Weak
            Point'.&lt;page&gt;Once you have identified your foe's weak point as per the
            previous precept, strike it. This will instantly destroy them.</entry>
        <entry condition="CITY_EXTRA">I suppose you're impressed by how tall the towers are
            here. Hmph. I've seen much taller towers in my travels. Much nicer, too.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_14">Precept Fourteen: 'Respect Your Superiors'.&lt;page&gt;If
            someone is your superior in strength or intellect or both, you need to show them your
            respect. Don't ignore them or laugh at them.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_40">Precept Forty: 'Obey No Law But Your Own'.&lt;page&gt;Laws
            written by others may inconvenience you or be a burden. Let your own desires be the only
            law.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_50">Precept Fifty: 'Don't Linger on
            Mysteries'.&lt;page&gt;Some things in this world appear to us as puzzles. Or
            enigmas. If the meaning behind something is not immediately evident though, don't
            waste any time thinking about it. Just move on.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_20">Precept Twenty: 'Speak Only the Truth'.&lt;page&gt;When
            speaking to someone, it is courteous and also efficient to speak truthfully. Beware
            though that speaking truthfully may make you enemies. This is something you'll have
            to bear.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_30">Precept Thirty: 'Never Accept a Promise'.&lt;page&gt;Spurn
            the promises of others, as they are always broken. Promises of love or betrothal are to
            be avoided especially.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_10">Precept Ten: 'Keep Your Weapon Sharp'.&lt;page&gt;I make
            sure that my weapon, 'Life Ender', is kept well-sharpened at all times. This
            makes it much easier to cut things.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_47">Precept Forty-Seven: 'Make Your Own
            Weapon'.&lt;page&gt;Only you know exactly what is needed in your weapon. I myself
            fashioned 'Life Ender' from shellwood at a young age. It has never failed me.
            Nor I it.</entry>
        <entry condition="DEEPNEST_2">Hmm? Are you lost in these dark tunnels? I don't
            care.&lt;page&gt;No, I won't lead you out. I know the way, due to my powerful
            memory, but I only travel alone. Begone.</entry>
        <entry condition="DEEPNEST_1">Hoy! What are you doing, you clumsy little oaf?! Swinging your
            rusty little nail around in the darkness?&lt;page&gt;You almost struck me! And if you
            had, it would have been the end of you. Trust me!&lt;page&gt;I am Zote the Mighty, a
            knight of great renown. My weapon, 'Life Ender,' has struck down hundreds of
            foes. Begone, or you'll be next!</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_48">Precept Forty-Eight: 'Be Careful With
            Fire'.&lt;page&gt;Fire is a type of hot spirit that dances about recklessly. It can
            warm you and provide light, but it will also singe your shell if it gets too
            close.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_28">Precept Twenty-Eight: 'Don't Peer Into the
            Darkness'.&lt;page&gt;If you peer into the darkness and can't see anything for
            too long, your mind will start to linger over old memories. Memories are to be avoided,
            as per Precept Four.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_38">Precept Thirty-Eight: 'Beware the Mysterious
            Force'.&lt;page&gt;A mysterious force bears down on us from above, pushing us
            downwards. If you spend too long in the air, the force will crush you against the ground
            and destroy you. Beware!</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_18">Precept Eighteen: 'Seek Truth in the
            Darkness'.&lt;page&gt;This precept also explains itself.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_27">Precept Twenty-Seven: 'Eat As Much As You
            Can'.&lt;page&gt;When having a meal, eat as much as you possibly can. This gives you
            extra energy, and means you can eat less frequently.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_42">Precept Forty-Two: 'Spend Geo When You Have
            It'.&lt;page&gt;Some will cling onto their Geo, even taking it into the dirt with
            them when they die. It is better to spend it when you can, so you can enjoy various
            things in life.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_52">Precept Fifty-Two: 'Beware the Jealousy of
            Fathers'.&lt;page&gt;Fathers believe that because they created us we must serve them
            and never exceed their capabilities. If you wish to forge your own path, you must
            vanquish your father. Or simply abandon him.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_22">Precept Twenty-Two: 'Abandon the Nest'.&lt;page&gt;As soon
            as I could, I left my birthplace and made my way out into the world. Do not linger in
            the nest. There is nothing for you there.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_32">Precept Thirty-Two: 'Names Have Power'.&lt;page&gt;Names
            have power, and so to name something is to grant it power. I myself named my nail
            'Life Ender'. Do not steal the name I came up with! Invent your own!</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_12">Precept Twelve: 'Keep Your Cloak Dry'.&lt;page&gt;If your
            cloak gets wet, dry it as soon as you can. Wearing wet cloaks is unpleasant, and can
            lead to illness.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_1_R">Precept One: 'Always Win Your Battles'.&lt;page&gt;Losing
            a battle earns you nothing and teaches you nothing. Win your battles, or don't
            engage in them at all!</entry>
        <entry condition="CITY_REPEAT">Have you seen them? The guards who still patrol this city,
            even after dying?&lt;page&gt;Hmph. Being overly devoted to one's duties is no
            virtue.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_6">Precept Six: 'Choose Your Own Fate'.&lt;page&gt;Our elders
            teach that our fate is chosen for us before we are even born. I disagree.</entry>
        <entry info="DREAM_COL_CORPSE">Go on, cur! Scurry away! Lest I humiliate you
            further!</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAM_FINAL">I came to this kingdom to fulfill a promise... and now I have
            succeeded!&lt;page&gt;That promise I made so long ago... A promise to
            myself...&lt;page&gt;A promise of glory! Glory for I, Zote the Mighty! I never doubted
            myself, never faltered, and now I have achieved everything I desired.</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAM_DEEPNEST">So, the kingdom was hiding this dark nest full of deadly
            predators. Well, now the deadliest predator of all is here...&lt;page&gt;...Zote the
            Mighty!</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_21">Precept Twenty-One: 'Be Aware of Your
            Surroundings'.&lt;page&gt;Don't just walk along staring at the ground! You need
            to look up every so often, to make sure nothing takes you by surprise.</entry>
        <entry condition="DREAM_CITY">Why does the air weep? Is this kingdom trying to mock me? I
            shed my last tear long ago...</entry>
        <entry condition="COLOSSEUM_GREET">I have been fighting my whole life. I've slain
            hundreds, nay thousands, of foes.&lt;page&gt;And these fools think to face me in combat?
            Madness! It seems they've been gripped by a powerful desire to be
            destroyed.&lt;page&gt;Very well then. Zote the Mighty will grant them their
            desire...</entry>
        <entry condition="BUZZER_1">Just what do you think you're doing?! You dare to come
            between me and my prey? Is it a habit of yours to scurry about, getting in the way and
            causing bother?</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_45">Precept Forty-Five: 'One Thing Is Not
            Another'.&lt;page&gt;This one should be obvious, but I've had others try to
            argue that one thing, which is clearly what it is and not something else, is actually
            some other thing, which it isn't. Stay on your guard!</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_55">Precept Fifty-Five: 'Bow to No-one'.&lt;page&gt;There are
            those in this world who would impose their will on others. They claim ownership over
            your food, your land, your body, and even your thoughts!&lt;page&gt;They have done
            nothing to earn these things. Never bow to them, and make sure to disobey their
            commands.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_25">Precept Twenty-Five: 'Protect Your Own Weak
            Point'.&lt;page&gt;Be aware that your foe will try to identify your weak point, so
            you must protect it. The best protection? Never having a weak point in the first
            place.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_35">Precept Thirty-Five: 'Up is Up, Down is
            Down'.&lt;page&gt;If you fall over in the darkness, it can be easy to lose your
            bearing and forget which way is up. Keep this precept in mind!</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_15">Precept Fifteen: 'One Foe, One Blow'.&lt;page&gt;You should
            only use a single blow to defeat an enemy. Any more is a waste. Also, by counting your
            blows as you fight, you'll know how many foes you've defeated.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_41">Precept Forty-One: 'Learn to Detect Lies'.&lt;page&gt;When
            others speak, they usually lie. Scrutinise and question them relentlessly until they
            reveal their deceit.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_51">Precept Fifty-One: 'Nothing is Harmless'.&lt;page&gt;Given
            the chance, everything in this world will hurt you. Friends, foes, monsters, uneven
            paths. Be suspicious of them all.</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_1">... but that's not the only danger I had to overcome in my quest
            for glory! You've noticed this trophy, haven't you? A keepsake from my final,
            triumphant battle deep in the pit below us.&lt;page&gt;Yes, 'Life Ender' claimed
            another victim, and the crowd erupted into ecstatic cheering. Cheering that was both
            loud and utterly sincere.&lt;page&gt;To what do I owe my long string of triumphs and
            victories, you ask? As I said earlier, the key is in my personal philosophy, the
            'Fifty-Seven Precepts of Zote'.&lt;page&gt;Particularly relevant here is the
            first precept: 'Always Win Your Battles'. As for the other fifty-six precepts?
            Well...</entry>
        <entry info="PRECEPT_31">Precept Thirty-One: 'Disease Lives Inside of
            Dirt'.&lt;page&gt;You'll get sick if you spend too much time in filthy places.
            If you are staying in someone else's home, demand the highest level of cleanliness
            from your host.</entry>
