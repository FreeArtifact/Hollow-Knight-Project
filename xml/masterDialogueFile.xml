        <entry name="LEG_EATER_GOLD1">Eaurgh... Eaaauuurrgggh?!&lt;page&gt;My charm! What did you do
            to it?! The smell... different. Strange, but nice. Very nice!&lt;page&gt;That smell...
            talks to me. Someone, somewhere... very nice.</entry>
        <entry name="GRIMM_RITUAL_COMPLETE">Across these lands my kin now spread, harvesting that
            essence peculiar to my... breed, the flame in dream.&lt;page&gt;Seek my kin; claim their
            flame and return it to me. Together, marvels shall be achieved.&lt;page&gt;But don&#39;t
            fret small one. For this task you won&#39;t travel alone. My child shall guide you to
            the flame and gather within itself that burning essence.&lt;page&gt;Like you, the child
            plays key role in this task. Only with it by your side will the flame, and my kin,
            reveal themselves to you.</entry>

        <entry name="NYMM_MEET">Ah. Hello! Hello! I&#39;m new around these parts, so it&#39;s
            marvelous to see so friendly a face, in such a sad town.&lt;page&gt;The old bug over
            there was very welcoming, but still I find the place a little melancholy, what with the
            wind, and the darkness, and the sense of decline... I was hoping my music could go some
            way to livening up the place.&lt;page&gt;And now you&#39;ve arrived with that wonderful,
            charming aura about you. The whole town feels brighter for it.&lt;page&gt;Before you
            hurry about your business, I&#39;ve a small gift to commemorate a wonderful new
            friendship. No use for it myself, but I believe it&#39;d look rather fancy upon
            you.&lt;page&gt;Please, enjoy it, and lets hope to see much more of one another about
            town.</entry>

            gift worth wearing, and my, my, it does suit you well.&lt;page&gt;To be honest, I&#39;m
            not even sure where I came upon it, but staring at its design, my memory stirs,
            something, and someone, forgotten, lost far away.&lt;page&gt;The specifics elude me, but
            a strange sense remains, fear, but also... longing? Like a strange nostalgia for
            something that never happened.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve no need for it in any case, so
            I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying it.</entry>

        <entry name="ELDERBUG_NYMM">Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and
            town&#39;s returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.&lt;page&gt;And
            we&#39;ve gained a new addition to the square! I found the fellow just outside of town.
            Seemed a little confused at first. Claims to be from far away, though he&#39;s hazy on
            the details.&lt;page&gt;Whatever his past, he&#39;s a rather good musician, and this
            town&#39;s spent far too long listening only to the wind. Thanks to him, we&#39;ve
            gained a new tune and some new company!</entry>
        <entry name="SLY_GRIMM">I&#39;ve been hearing about the strangers that have come to town.
            They&#39;re strange indeed from what&#39;s been told.&lt;page&gt;What interest does this
            tired little place hold for them? I&#39;m thinking you may know the answer to
            that.&lt;page&gt;None of my business of course, but I&#39;d be wary of their deals and
            promises. Keep your nail half-drawn, if you understand me.</entry>

            from this dead Kingdom. You would claim it... for our Master. For his final
            act.&lt;page&gt;The Ritual plays itself out once more. We are like the notes in an old,
            old song. You and me. Mrmm.</entry>
        <entry name="JIJI_GRIMM">Hmm. A fierce host has settled nearby. Did you summon them? I find
            their smell... unsettling.&lt;page&gt;Theirs is a scent of distant places, unfamiliar
            even to me.&lt;page&gt;They have a strange look to them, gaudy and intimidating. Perhaps
            you suspect they hide their true appearance? You&#39;d be right. They favour projection
            over truth, shrouding themselves in forms dreamed.&lt;page&gt;Best be careful. Assisting
            them might benefit you, but who knows what suffering it may cause?</entry>

            its end. Will you continue to harvest the flame, even though now you surely see the path
            it illuminates for us?&lt;page&gt;Our scarlet eyes will watch you keenly...

            talents... heehee.&lt;page&gt;Oh! I do apologise. I&#39;ve just felt a rumbling down

            troupe.&lt;page&gt;The lantern has been lit, and your summons heeded. A fine stage you
            choose, this kingdom fallowed by worm and root, perfect earth upon which our Ritual
            shall take place.&lt;page&gt;And you, my friend. Your own part is far from over.</entry>
        <entry name="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_NF_1">Mrmm. You came.&lt;page&gt;You have gathered the flame and
            so the time for the ritual&#39;s completion is upon us. All you must do now is return to
            the Master...&lt;page&gt;Thus it goes, as it ever has. We are like the notes in an old,
            old song. You and me. Mrmm.&lt;page&gt;And yet... It is not merely by fortune that we
            meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master&#39;s scarlet
            eyes can not see us.&lt;page&gt;Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at
            all.&lt;page&gt;You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it
            so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in
            peace.&lt;page&gt;If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it
            began... </entry>
        <entry name="DIVINE_CHARM_EQUIPPED">Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!&lt;page&gt;That charm... beautiful!
            Most precious thing! Little lovely, will you let me see it? Have to show it to me! </entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_GRIMM">Ahh! Look there! Something strange and sinister has suddenly

            us?&lt;page&gt;Ahhh. It doesn&#39;t matter. Don&#39;t tell me.&lt;page&gt;We came, and I
            can smell something. Something deep below us. I want it... I want it!</entry>
        <entry name="NYMM_FINAL">Dear friend, I heard a violent scream from below. Even my song
            could not mask such a horrible shriek. Was it pain, or rage? I find I&#39;m rather
            sensitive to such things.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re planning to head down, please do stay
            safe. I&#39;d be dreadfully upset if I forever lost your company.</entry>

            my gift back, do you?&lt;page&gt;Eeuuarrggh! So nasty, so cruel, if that&#39;s true!
            Once you give something as a gift it&#39;s lost to you forever!</entry>

        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_TRUTH">My dapper gadfly, would you care to know how charms are made?
            I don&#39;t often tell my customers, what with the truth being a little morbid. But
            you&#39;re a sharp one so you may have guessed already.&lt;page&gt;Few ways a charm
            appears but mainly it&#39;s from final wish, a dying bug&#39;s potent desire
            crystallised into these gorgeous, powerful trinkets.&lt;page&gt;Now don&#39;t go getting
            too sad. There are exceptions of course, and really, it&#39;s quite beautiful, makes
            them all the more precious. Mmhhmm.&lt;page&gt;Just think of all the little bug souls
            that went into creating your collection! It&#39;s like a crowd of strangers in your
            pouch, or purse, or...err....wherever it is you keep them.</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_DREAM">...Dear dear, I really must hold it together, must appear
            calm, but this creature... is just divine...</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_3A">Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I can see
            you&#39;ve started your own collection. Very nice! I&#39;ll show you some of my own, and
            you can take one home with you if you like!</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_1">Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you surprised me! Hello, hello! Come
            in, sweetling! Come in and make yourself at home.</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_3B">Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I&#39;m
            surprised a stylish little gadfly like yourself isn&#39;t wearing any,
            actually.&lt;page&gt;Charms are gorgeous, mystical, one-of-a-kind accessories with a
            spark of power woven into their cores. Just wearing one is enough to change your life!
            You&#39;ll do things you never thought possible!&lt;page&gt;Take a look at some of the
            Charms I have for sale. You can take one home with you if you like!</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_OVERCHARM">It&#39;s a bit of a sin to wear too many Charms at once,
            isn&#39;t it? Sometimes less is more! Mmmm!&lt;page&gt;Yes, you shouldn&#39;t try to
            cram on more Charms than you can handle. The effect could be positively
            overwhelming!</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_COMBO">Do you wear a lot of Charms at once? It&#39;s a lot of fun
            isn&#39;t it, mixing and matching them to get the perfect combination?&lt;page&gt;I
            don&#39;t know whether you&#39;ve noticed, but some Charms seem to like each other. Yes!
            Mmm! When Charms like each other, they shine even brighter and sing even more
            sweetly!&lt;page&gt;Even more reason to try all sorts of fun and surprising combinations
            of Charms! Mmmmmmm! You&#39;ll show me whenever you have a new favourite, right?</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_1">My dear. A blessing for you. With your excessive
            patronage and those startling good looks, you&#39;ve more than earned it. </entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOSTOCK">Goodness, goodness. You&#39;ve gone and bought all my lovely
            charms! What a stunning, colourful collection you&#39;ve amassed. Mmmmmm! You&#39;re
            even more the attractive bug, clad in all those wonderful, sparkling
            things.&lt;page&gt;I may have nothing more to give, but you must come back and visit
            from time to time. Such a dashing figure frequenting my store. I bet the whole village
            is jealous. Mmm hmm!</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_2">I&#39;m Salubra, and this is my cosy little Charm store. Did
            the townfolk out there tell you to come and visit me? Mmm, yes! This is a lovely little
            village isn&#39;t it? Warm and intimate and full of life.</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_1">Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you&#39;re building up quite the
            Charm collection, aren&#39;t you? Quite the little connoisseur. I&#39;d bet you&#39;d
            like to wear more Charms at once, hmm? I&#39;ve got a special item for sale that I think
            you&#39;ll be very, verrrry interested in! Mmm! </entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_2">Oooohhhh! You flamboyant little gadfly! Your Charm
            collection has expanded quite a bit, hasn&#39;t it? I think it&#39;s about time you
            bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself!
            Mmmm!</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_3">Oooohhhh! Your charm collection is getting positively
            enormous! I&#39;m so jealous! I think it&#39;s about time you bought another Notch so
            you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_4">Mmmmmmmmm! Look at you! Every time I see you,
            you&#39;ve collected even more Charms! I think it&#39;s about time you bought another
            Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_2">Mmmmmm yess... I hope my blessing brings you everything
            you desire! Don&#39;t be a stranger sweetums.</entry>
        <entry name="CHARMSLUG_REPEAT">It&#39;s rare enough that someone enters my store, but even
            rarer to meet one so striking!&lt;page&gt;Those impressive horns! That fierce weapon.

        <entry name="FUNGAL_WASTES_GREET">Ahh my short friend, you&#39;ve caught me at the perfect
            time. I&#39;m just about finished charting these noxious caverns.&lt;page&gt;Very
            territorial types make their homes within this area. I&#39;d suggest avoiding them where
            possible.&lt;page&gt;Further below some strange thin creatures gave me quite a scare.
            They seemed an intelligent bunch.&lt;page&gt;In my youth I&#39;d have braved their caves
            but I fear my matured physique wouldn&#39;t be able to outrun them were they to turn
            violent.</entry>
        <entry name="GREENPATH_GREET">Isn&#39;t this a contrast from the Crossroads? Such a humid,
            lively place. The roads twist and turn in the most wonderful ways.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve
            done my best to chart the area ahead, though I must admit some of the area&#39;s
            inhabitants proved quite a nuisance.</entry>
        <entry name="CROSSROADS_BOUGHT">How are you finding my map? I&#39;ve tried to fill out as
            much as I can, but every map is a work in progress.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;d like to fill
            out some of the map yourself you can purchase some mapping supplies from my wife up in
            Dirtmouth. We&#39;ve set up a little store to help make ends meet.</entry>
        <entry name="MINES_GREET">Come to scale the mountain? I&#39;ve heard tale of a summit way up
            there. Too far for me though and I&#39;m not really one for heights. </entry>
        <entry name="CORNIFER_AGAIN_DP">Y-you want to buy a map after all?</entry>
        <entry name="CROSSROADS_GREET">Hello again! Still winding your way through these beautiful
            highways? Just imagine how they must have looked during the kingdom&#39;s height, thick
            with traffic and bustling with life! I wish I could have seen it.&lt;page&gt;Oh, and I
            suppose I should ask... are you interested in buying a copy of my map for this
            area...?</entry>
        <entry name="FUNGAL_WASTES_BOUGHT">There&#39;s a potent odour about these caverns and far
            worse for me I suspect. My trunk is quite sensitive whereas you don&#39;t seem to
            possess a scent organ of any kind.&lt;page&gt;Is it that you cannot smell at
            all?</entry>
        <entry name="CLIFFS_GREET">Enjoying the bracing air? We&#39;re quite close to
            Hallownest&#39;s borders and those desolate plains that surround it. &lt;page&gt;In this
            direction, I&#39;m about as far as I&#39;m willing to go, though it&#39;s been a
            pleasant change from the tight confines of the caverns.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve drawn out a
            small map for the area. It&#39;s a simple one and more for completion really. Not
            knowing the full extents of a region can be quite frustrating.</entry>
        <entry name="FOG_CANYON_GREET">Ho ho! As odd as much of Hallownest can be, there&#39;s a
            whole new level of strangeness about these caves.&lt;page&gt;Did you see that dark gate
            below? It&#39;s quite unsettling to be near. I did my best to avoid
            it.&lt;page&gt;Fortunate for me, I found another route in, though I did end up a little
            singed after wading through some acid.</entry>
        <entry name="MINES_BOUGHT">I jabbed myself on one of those crystals back there. Awful sharp
            they are and all over the place. You&#39;d best watch yourself if you&#39;re heading up. </entry>
        <entry name="WATERWAYS_BOUGHT">I&#39;d wager these pipes and chambers were once used to
            carry the city&#39;s waste. Would&#39;ve been a horrid stench down here. Thankfully that
            constant rain has flushed them clean. </entry>

            kingdom above? It&#39;s a heavy thing alright. &lt;page&gt;I reckon not many&#39;d reach
            these depths. We&#39;re pioneers you and I, at least in recent history.</entry>
        <entry name="CORNIFER_ISELDA">A map can be a useful thing, but it alone won&#39;t show you
            where you are. If you&#39;ve not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a compass
            from my wife, Iselda.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s just now opening our new map shop in
            Dirtmouth, selling all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself. She&#39;ll
            even sell some of my old maps from time to time.&lt;page&gt;I pop back to see her
            whenever I finish mapping an area. She&#39;s always so excited to see me.</entry>
        <entry name="DEEPNEST_GREET">This p-place gives me the creeps. Vicious little creatures
            burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark, twisting
            maze.&lt;page&gt;Unless you&#39;re well prepared, I&#39;d urge you to leave, though if
            you&#39;re feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy my map?</entry>
        <entry name="DEEPNEST_BOUGHT">W-w-what a horrid warren of angry beasts. It&#39;s going to
            take a whole lot of effort to climb out of this dark pit. I think I-I&#39;ll hide here a
            little longer. </entry>
        <entry name="FOG_CANYON_BOUGHT">There&#39;s a large building just below here, out in the
            middle of a lake and a marvel to observe.&lt;page&gt;I tried to head in, but it&#39;s
            become a nest for those slimey, see-through creatures.&lt;page&gt;Ugh. They&#39;re just
            so... gross, and they give a nasty shock to touch. </entry>
        <entry name="CORNIFER_INTRO_1">Oh, by the way, I haven&#39;t introduced myself have I? Yes,
            I should apologise for that. When you spend a lot of time by yourself, with just your
            own thoughts, you forget the niceties of conversation.</entry>

        <entry name="CITY_BOUGHT">We&#39;ve both come far to reach this grand place. While I&#39;m
            about these buildings, I must remember to collect a trinket or two for Iselda. </entry>
        <entry name="CORNIFER_REFUSE">Not interested, then? Yes, quite understandable. Exploring
            without a map, finding your own way through unknown caverns... All very nourishing for
            the soul.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps we&#39;ll meet again on our travels.</entry>
        <entry name="CORNIFER_INTRO_2">My name is Cornifer, and I&#39;ve always loved exploring the

            Dirtmouth with my wife. A huge, unending Kingdom to explore right on our doorstep. Who
            could resist?&lt;page&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ll let you return to your travels. With a little

            I&#39;ve tried to chart the dense nest beneath here b-b-but it&#39;s proving too
            dangerous for a bug like me.&lt;page&gt;Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over
            the place and the passages are a dark, twisting maze. Even with my good head for
            direction, I-I-I&#39;ve had enough&lt;page&gt;Unless you&#39;re well prepared, I&#39;d

        <entry name="CLIFFS_BOUGHT">I chanced upon a strange bug atop these cliffs. His house
            isn&#39;t far from here. &lt;page&gt;A very imposing figure he was and no doubt lethal
            with a Nail. I suspect you two might share more in common than him and I.</entry>
        <entry name="ROYAL_GARDENS_BOUGHT">There&#39;s a Stag Station at the heart of these gardens.

            lost and finding your way again is a pleasure like no other. We&#39;re exquisitely
            lucky, you and I.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m a cartographer by trade, and I&#39;m working on

        <entry name="WATERWAYS_GREET">Ho ho! Aren&#39;t these waterways thrilling? A labyrinth of

            talents. It&#39;s all so orderly, so considered, nothing like the crude irregularity of
            those caverns.&lt;page&gt;Ahh but so sad, my trunk is telling me those Fungal Wastes are
            close and I sense my damp adventure may have reached its end. Guess I&#39;ll be calling
            this map done.</entry>

            Iselda worrying after me.</entry>
        <entry name="CITY_GREET">Isn&#39;t this a change from those twisting natural caverns? The
            rain does cast something of a sadness upon it all but the architecture is simply

    <entries type="Dream_Witch">
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_8A">Yes. The time has come. The Dream Nail... And you as well,
            Wielder. It is time for you both to awaken.&lt;page&gt;The Essence you have
            collected...The hope that still remains in this old Kingdom. Pure potential! Let it
            course through you and into the Dream Nail.&lt;page&gt;Hold it aloft, Wielder! Awaken! </entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_FINAL_1">So much Essence... So bright.... You truly are the Wielder my
            tribe so long has dreamed of.&lt;page&gt;The folk of my tribe were born from a light.
            Light similar to Essence, similar to that powerful blade, though much brighter
            still.&lt;page&gt;They were content to bask in that light and honoured it... for a
            time.&lt;page&gt;But another light appeared in our world... A wyrm that took the form of
            a king.&lt;page&gt;How fickle my ancestors must have been. They forsook the light that
            spawned them. Turned their backs to it... Forgot it even.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_MEET_A">Ahhhh, you&#39;ve returned. Welcome back to the waking
            world.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_5">So, you already have 700 Essence. I wonder whether the Dreamers
            are watching you as you work. Or even that old King.&lt;page&gt;That lock of theirs.
            Desperate, but very clever. I wonder how long they thought it could hold?&lt;page&gt;I
            hold no disdain for them though. As history goes on I grow numb to its
            repetitions.&lt;page&gt;Take your gift and continue collecting Essence. Once you have
            900, come back and visit me.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_7">Yes, I thought so. More than 1500 Essence. The Dream Nail is
            close... so close to fully awakening!&lt;page&gt;Continue on your path, Wielder. I know
            not what guides you, nor what will it is that drives you forward. Once you have
            collected 1800 Essence though, I will be here waiting.&lt;page&gt;Take this gift, may it
            grant you strength and help you to collect the Essence of this world!</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_4">Ahhhhh. 500 Essence. You&#39;re a master in the making. Well
            done! Well done! I&#39;ve a small reward for you.&lt;page&gt;Plucked from one of my most
            precious memories, this Charm will bring you and the Dream Nail closer together still.
            The secrets of this kingdom won&#39;t be able to hide from you any
            longer!&lt;page&gt;Take it, and return once you have collected 700 Essence. More gifts
            await you...</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_GENERIC">This kingdom is full of old memories, both beautiful and
            grotesque. Seek them out, reveal them, and gather Essence.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_MEET_B">Ahhhh, you&#39;ve found your way back to me. When you awoke you
            just up and left. I thought perhaps I&#39;d frightened you.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_8B">Ahhhh, ah ha, yes...&lt;page&gt;No dream can hide itself from
            you now. You can peer into the darkest places... You just need to find the right
            crack.&lt;page&gt;What will you do with such a power, Wielder? Whose memories will you
            hunt down?&lt;page&gt;Hah. Do as you wish, my promise is fulfilled. May the crimes of my
            tribe be washed away in time, like the rest of this Kingdom&#39;s...</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_FINAL_3">Aahh... I&#39;m sorry...&lt;page&gt;Light...
            Radiance...&lt;page&gt;I... remember you.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_INTRO">Those figures, those Dreamers... they reached out with what little
            power they still have and dragged you into that hidden place.&lt;page&gt;But that
            talisman you now wield, the Dream Nail... it can cut through the veil that separates the
            waking world from our dreams. Even the Dreamers themselves can not hide from such a
            weapon.&lt;page&gt;Though I must admit, that sacred blade has dulled over time. Together
            perhaps, we can restore its power. You only have to bring me
            Essence.&lt;page&gt;Essence... the precious fragments of light that dreams are made of.
            Collect it wherever you find it, and bring it to me. Once we have enough, we can work
            wonders together.&lt;page&gt;Go out into the world, Wielder. Hunt down the Essence that
            lingers there!&lt;page&gt;Collect 100 Essence and return to me. I will teach you
            more...</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_3">So you&#39;ve collected 300 Essence... Yes, I can see the
            dreams of this old Kingdom are starting to cling to you. Very
            encouraging.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve certainly made my dreary work here more exciting.
            Being the caretaker of this place hasn&#39;t been very stimulating.&lt;page&gt;I
            shouldn&#39;t complain though. Tending these graves and guiding the Wielder... all
            penitence for old crimes. Certain things have to be kept in balance.&lt;page&gt;Take
            this trinket for your efforts, and return with 500 Essence. Keep up your tireless
            work!</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_FINAL_2">And so this kingdom was born from that betrayal. But the
            memories of that ancient light still lingered, hush whispers of faith... Until all of
            Hallownest began to dream of that forgotten light.&lt;page&gt;Ah, but what&#39;s done is
            done. And so am I. The Wielder has at last appeared and I&#39;ve held the memories of my
            tribe for long enough. It is time for us to be forgotten too.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t
            remember us, Wielder. Don&#39;t honour us. We do not deserve it...</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_HINT_DREAMPLANT">Essence can be found wherever dreams take
            root.&lt;page&gt;Have you seen them? Those whispering plants that grow all over this old
            Kingdom? I believe there is one just outside. Why not strike it with your Dream Nail,
            and see what happens?</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_1">Hmm, already you&#39;ve collected 100 Essence. Quick work!
            Things come naturally to you, don&#39;t they?&lt;page&gt;No wonder the Dreamers tried to
            bury you in that old dream. Perhaps you frighten them? Or perhaps, being prisoners
            themselves, they desired your company?&lt;page&gt;In any case, you still have a long way
            to go. Take this old trinket as encouragement from me, and return when you have
            collected 200 Essence.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_6">The Dream Nail glows bright... It holds over 1200 Essence.
            Looking into it I can see so many memories peering back at me. So many asking to be
            remembered.&lt;page&gt;None of us can live forever, and so we ask those who survive to
            remember us.&lt;page&gt;Hold something in your mind and it lives on with you, but forget
            it and you seal it away forever. That is the only death that matters.&lt;page&gt;Huh, so
            they say! Enough of that though. Take this relic and come back to me with 1500 Essence.
            Go!</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_2A">Ahhh... Your Dream Nail holds over 200 Essence. You&#39;re
            proving your talent in its collection.&lt;page&gt;Have you seen that great door just
            outside? My tribe closed it long ago and forbade its opening.&lt;page&gt;Ah, but as far
            as I can tell I&#39;m the only member of my tribe still breathing. That means I
            needn&#39;t feel bad about breaking a taboo. As proof of my belief in you, I&#39;ll open
            the door.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_1">Hm. You are still unpracticed in the way of dreams. Collect 100
            Essence with the Dream Nail; visit me again and I will share what little wisdom I
            have.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_3">You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still
            have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 300 Essence.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_2">You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still
            have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 200 Essence.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_5">Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail,
            haven&#39;t you? Return to me once you have collected 700 Essence and I will teach you
            more.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_4">Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail,
            haven&#39;t you? Return to me once you have collected 500 Essence and I will teach you

        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_7">Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up, return
            to me once you have collected 1500 Essence.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_6">Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up. Return
            to me once you have collected 1200 Essence.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_9">The Dream Nail has fully awoken, yet still you collect Essence.
            Perhaps I&#39;ve instilled an obsession in you?&lt;page&gt;Keep at it, then! I&#39;m
            happy to wait and watch your progress.&lt;page&gt;Once you have collected 2400 Essence,
            return to me. I&#39;ve no more gifts to give... but you&#39;d prove yourself the Wielder
            my tribe awaited.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_8">Incredible... the Dream Nail, it is so close to fully awakening!
            Collect more Essence! Once you have 1800 Essence, something truly marvellous will
            happen!</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_2B">There, the door is open and you can enter the glade beyond it.
            Listen closely in there and you may hear the utterings of bugs long gone.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_QUEST_5B">My my, you&#39;re almost starting to become a dream yourself!
            Once you have collected 900 Essence I&#39;ll teach you a trick that I&#39;ve kept hidden
            for a long time...</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_GREET">Ah, Wielder, you&#39;ve returned. Let me have a look at the Dream
            Nail...</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_REWARD_5B">The Dream Nail now holds 900 Essence within its core! Are you
            surprised that this old kingdom has so many hidden dreams?&lt;page&gt;Yes, you&#39;re
            starting to see them. The connections between us and the dreams we leave behind, like
            prints in the dust. The time has come for you to learn how to revisit the places
            connected to you!&lt;page&gt;Hold the Dream Nail tight, wielder, and imagine a great
            gate opening before you!</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_HINT_XERO">Sometimes dreams take the shape of those who have passed away.
            Such dreams are bountiful sources of Essence!&lt;page&gt;You should search carefully
            near graves and other monuments. Why, I believe I saw an interesting gravestone here in
            the Resting Grounds.&lt;page&gt;If you do decide to disturb those dreams though, be
            prepared for a fight...</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_DREAM1">What a terrible fate they&#39;ve visited upon you.&lt;page&gt;To
            cast you away into this space between body and soul.&lt;page&gt;Will you accept their
            judgement and fade slowly away?&lt;page&gt;Or will you take the weapon before you, and
            cut your way out of this sad, forgotten dream?</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_DREAM_FALL">Though you may fall, your will shall carry you
            forward.&lt;page&gt;A dream is endless, but a Kingdom is not.&lt;page&gt;The power to
            wake this world from its slumber... you only need to reach out and take it.</entry>
        <entry name="WITCH_DREAM">What are you doing, poking about in a dusty old mind like mine?
            Nothing of worth is hidden inside, believe me.&lt;page&gt;But keep probing the world
            around you with your Dream Nail... Hidden things will reveal themselves.</entry>

            friend.&lt;page&gt;As I was walking amongst the tombstones, I noticed a strange kind of
            chanting coming from somewhere nearby. Extremely sinister chanting!&lt;page&gt;I looked
            around to find the source, and I saw two bright, horrible, huge eyes staring at me from
            the door of a dark cave!&lt;page&gt;I pretended I hadn&#39;t heard the voice or seen the
            eyes and scurried back to town. My friend will have to wait a little longer for her

        <entry name="ELDERBUG_KINGS_PASS">To reach Dirtmouth, most travellers take circuitous routes
            around the cliffs beside us. It&#39;s a hard trek now but in the kingdom&#39;s prime
            things were far simpler.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an old pass in the cliffs that once
            allowed easy access. The bridge up to it has long since crumbled away, and even without
            it, a huge door bars entry.&lt;page&gt;I can&#39;t complain mind you. It&#39;s meant
            we&#39;ve only ever had to accommodate a trickle of travellers, even during our busiest
            times.&lt;page&gt;I wouldn&#39;t want hordes of bugs to descend on Dirtmouth. I like the
            quiet.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_GOSSIP_HINT">It&#39;s a sprawling land beneath us. If you&#39;re ever
            feeling lost or would care for some direction, come speak with me. I may be able to
            suggest a new sight or a new path you&#39;d never before
            considered.&lt;page&gt;Suprised? Despite my lack of experience, I&#39;m actually quite
            knowledgeable about the lay of the kingdom below. I&#39;ve listened to countless stories
            from travellers and explorers just like yourself.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll
            have your own grand tale to tell once you&#39;re finished down there. Either that or
            you&#39;ll be dead! I&#39;ll admit, in Hallownest, the latter is far more
            common.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_ANCIENT_BASIN">Did you know the caverns continue even below the
            capital? Few have ventured that deep so the details are scant.&lt;page&gt;Those who made
            it back told of impossibly old structures and roads formed as though the rock itself
            possessed a will.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_INTRO_VISITEDCROSSROAD">Oh! You&#39;re back! You walked straight past
            me and descended down into the ruins without even saying hello! I thought maybe I&#39;d
            seen a ghost.&lt;page&gt;The mind sometimes plays tricks on you when you spend a lot of
            time alone.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_STAG_STATION_REOPENED">I never thought I&#39;d see such a thing. The
            Stag Station has opened! That building lay silent since before even my
            time.&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;ve heard the tales of the glorious lines. A web of tunnels
            running all through the kingdom. Not that I&#39;ll be travelling them, mind
            you!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m quite content where I am.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_CRYSTAL_PEAK">Did you see that tall cliff beyond the town&#39;s
            graveyard? That&#39;s only the base of a much larger peak.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s mines
            and machinery and all sorts of valuable rock forms inside. Many a traveller through
            Dirtmouth headed straight for it.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_BLACK_EGG_OPENED">I heard a piercing cry from the well. It echoed
            about my mind and left me all a daze.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d say it was a foul beast&#39;s
            death, but this cry sounded different...divine? Has something happened little
            traveller?&lt;page&gt;No. Don&#39;t tell me. If foul events are brewing, it&#39;s
            probably better I don&#39;t know.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_INTRO_NORMAL">Ho there, traveller. I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s only me

        <entry name="ELDERBUG_GENERIC_2">Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you
            it&#39;s quite comfortable. There&#39;s no better place to collect your thoughts before
            heading below. &lt;page&gt;Plus I enjoy the company. Not that you seem the talkative
            sort.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_DUNG">Can you... smell something? There&#39;s suddenly a horrid stench
            in the air.&lt;page&gt;I swear, the town usually smells much nicer than this. Please
            accept my humble apology!</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_ACCEPT">Ah! I can really have it? My, my... I barely know what
            to say except... thank you!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d resigned myself to selflessly giving out
            advice to passers by, without receiving any gratitude in return. Little did I know, one
            young bug was taking my words to heart and would repay my kindness.&lt;page&gt;And with
            such a beautiful gift! Ahh. Suddenly, the world seems a little less
            faded.&lt;page&gt;Thank you, my friend. I will take care of this flower while you&#39;re
            gone, so we can enjoy it together when you return.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_FUNGAL_WASTES">My understanding of Hallownest can be a little
            vague, but below those leafy caverns is a fungal grove, once home to peaceful creatures
            not quite bug and not quite plant.&lt;page&gt;Sounds almost worth a visit no? Well
            there&#39;s a downside, the dreadful stench! A noxious odour fills the place. </entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HISTORY_2">I hope you aren&#39;t too disappointed by our little town,
            traveller. Though it&#39;s now a solemn place, once we were much more
            welcoming.&lt;page&gt;Entry to the kingdom was forbidden long ago, supposedly after some
            great calamity. Many gates were closed, but our old well remains as a way to creep back
            in.&lt;page&gt;Over the years, all kinds used the well to wriggle into the ruins,
            wanderers, thieves, adventurers.&lt;page&gt;Funny how few ever come back up. Perhaps
            they find what they&#39;re looking for?..&lt;page&gt;Bah, I&#39;m not so naive. No
            doubt, they&#39;ve all been gobbled up! There are countless dangers in those
            depths.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HISTORY_1">Many used to come, hoping the kingdom would fulfill their
            desires. &lt;page&gt;Hallownest, it was once called. Supposedly the greatest kingdom
            there ever was, full of treasures and secrets.&lt;page&gt;Hm. Now it&#39;s nothing more
            than a poisonous tomb full of monsters and madness.&lt;page&gt;Everything fades
            eventually, I suppose.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_GREENPATH">I used to think the kingdom below was all dead cold
            rock, but I&#39;ve since been told different. Travellers speak of startling variety in
            Hallownest&#39;s caverns. Even just besides those Crossroads there&#39;s meant to be an
            area filled with leafy greenery.&lt;page&gt;I told those same travellers about the
            wonderful grasses that grow around the town. They didn&#39;t seem impressed. </entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_DECLINE">Oh. My mistake. Yes. Very foolish of me. I don&#39;t
            know why I thought you&#39;d go to so much effort for a simple old
            bug.&lt;page&gt;Appreciating others and being considerate... these aren&#39;t skills
            that everyone is born with.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_GENERIC">This flower you gave me... when dark thoughts creep
            into my head I gaze at it and think of you.&lt;page&gt;Why not rest at the bench here
            for a while? We can enjoy the flower together before you head off again.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_BRETTA_RETURNED">That lovely young lass returned to us!&lt;page&gt;I
            must admit, I&#39;d placed thin odds on her survival.&lt;page&gt;Seems to think very
            highly of her rescuer, some sort of dashing, warrior type. Barely stopped gushing since
            she got back.&lt;page&gt;The warrior must have passed down below whilst I was taking my
            nap. Such a shame. I&#39;d have loved to meet so impressive a bug.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_INTRO_MAIN">The other residents, they&#39;ve all disappeared. Headed
            down that well, one by one, into the caverns below.&lt;page&gt;Used to be there was a
            great kingdom beneath our town. It&#39;s long fell to ruin, yet it still draws folks
            into its depths.&lt;page&gt;Wealth, glory, enlightenment, that darkness seems to promise
            all things. I&#39;m sure you too seek your dreams down there.&lt;page&gt;Well watch out.
            It&#39;s a sickly air that fills the place. Creatures turn mad and travellers are robbed
            of their memories.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps dreams aren&#39;t such great things after
            all...</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_CITY_OF_TEARS">Hallownest&#39;s great capital is what most of you
            brave types come to see. Thinking to loot its treasures I suppose? It must be brimming
            with them.&lt;page&gt;The city&#39;s right at the centre of the kingdom, though I&#39;ve
            heard the gates are sealed, so gaining entry can be difficult.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;d be a
            rich bug that could return with even a fraction of the wealth inside. Despite my age,
            I&#39;ve only seen few who&#39;ve managed it. Must say something of the dangers about
            its streets.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_4">If you do meet my fellows down there you might remind
            them of their poor Elder, up here, back aching, abandoned to his lonesome vigil. Poor
            poor me!...&lt;page&gt;Oh I&#39;m fine, really, but a bit of guilt might go some way in
            persuading their return. Assuming they&#39;re still alive that is.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_REREQUEST">You&#39;re still holding onto that exquisite

        <entry name="ELDERBUG_MAP_SHOP_OPEN">A young couple&#39;s just recently taken up residence
            in the house beside the station. Seems they&#39;re running a map shop, which may excite
            adventurous types like yourself.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s a tall bug, the wife. I told them
            to take a larger house, especially given they&#39;re all empty, but they liked the look
            of that one.&lt;page&gt;The way she has to bend just to get through the door...I
            wouldn&#39;t put up with it myself.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_TEMPLE_VISITED">Did you visit that temple? A strange building I&#39;ve
            heard, though I&#39;d never dare the journey myself.&lt;page&gt;The braver among us once
            went there to pray, said they felt at peace within the walls. After a while, they

        <entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_RESTING_GROUNDS">Apparently, the many graves of Hallownest are
            enough to fill an entire network of caverns. Somewhere above the city it&#39;s told.
            Sounds a gloomy sight.&lt;page&gt;Bah, I&#39;m content with our own humble plot. In our
            boom times, we even had a gravedigger! Not a bad sort he was, though dead
            now.&lt;page&gt;He, didn&#39;t die to the dangers of Hallownest mind you. That one fell
            into an open grave and couldn&#39;t climb out.&lt;page&gt;I found the corpse myself.
            Dreadful nuisance. I&#39;ve since had to tend the graves myself.</entry>
        <entry name="ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_3">Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you
            it’s quite comfortable. There&#39;s no better place to collect your thoughts before
            heading below.&lt;page&gt;Plus, I&#39;d enjoy the company, even if you&#39;re not the
            most talkative sort.</entry>

        <entry name="MARKOTH_TALK">You have come a long way, just to die here at the edge of the
            world.&lt;page&gt;No, do not speak. I have heard thousands and thousands of empty words
            from those like you. Your pride, your desires, your desperation... you will take these

        <entry name="MUMCAT_DEFEAT">Oh, stranger... you&#39;re strong. Much stronger than

            long time, stranger.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m very, very tired! The Queen will be here soon,
            and I just need to sleep a little.&lt;page&gt;Wake me when the Queen arrives, stranger.

        <entry name="XERO_TALK">Stop there! Those who try to leave this kingdom are cursed. Better
            to rest here, until time itself sleeps.&lt;page&gt;Hope and freedom. I thought that
            strength alone could grant me these things. In my dreams I would cut that plague with my
            nails, and then I turned my weapons upon the King.&lt;page&gt;When I awoke in this
            sacred place, I began to understand. Those who hope are already doomed.&lt;page&gt;Do

        <entry name="MAGE_LORD">In my dreams I could see it. The Kingdom&#39;s salvation, the cure

            the King... why?! He opposed everything I did...&lt;page&gt;His jealousy... his
            madness... by standing against me he robbed me of my immortality!&lt;page&gt;Now the

            believe. &lt;page&gt;Huge crowds once flocked to hear me sing, then something changed.
            The audience, once so enrapt, began to leave. I continued to sing yet my voice fell
            silent upon their ears.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you&#39;d care to listen to me sing?

            are a rare breed, quite unlike this poor fellow who has fallen before us. The world is

            I&#39;d thought it a temporary stop, then my husband became obsessed with that old
            ruin.&lt;page&gt;Now he&#39;s spending all his time down there. He argues cartography is

            I&#39;m still lost for company.&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, but I do love the bug, even his faults.
            Seeing his passion for maps, it&#39;s something of an inspiration.&lt;page&gt;Corny
            keeps asking me to join him on his adventures and I&#39;ve always declined. Maybe next

        <entry name="ISELDA_TRAMPIN">Apparently Hallownest has giant metal carriages called trams?
            Sounds unecessary to me, given those old stag lines that Corny always talks
            about.&lt;page&gt;Still, I&#39;ve made a pin to represent a tram station. Might be
            useful if you&#39;re inclined to make your map more detailed.&lt;page&gt;It wasn&#39;t
            too hard to make, so I&#39;m not charging a premium for it.</entry>

            not a bad thing. Who&#39;d want to buy a pin of a limp root?</entry>

            spent.Amongst it sprang a dreadful scourge,that forced return our aggressive urge,and
            turned us back to beasts or husks,Our souls consumed by light above.Within your corpse

            our eyes.&lt;page&gt;Mighty Hegemol was always my favourite. What a towering figure he
            was, though surprisingly soft spoken for one so large.&lt;page&gt;They were all
            impressive in their own right, of course. Fierce Dryya, kindly Isma, mysterious
            Ze&#39;mer... erm, and the other one.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_SLY">That charm! Only the Great Nailsage could have given that to
            you...&lt;page&gt;Seeing how strong you&#39;ve become... it almost makes me want to take
            up my nail once more.&lt;page&gt;But no, I should stay on my current path and keep
            working at my art. If the Great Nailsage ever comes by, I want to show him how far
            I&#39;ve come.</entry>
        <entry name="ORO_GREET">You&#39;ve returned, though you were not invited. &lt;page&gt;As my

        <entry name="MATO_SLY">That charm...! Could it be?! Only the Great Nailsage himself could
            have bestowed such a thing!&lt;page&gt;Your achievements humble my own, my pupil. I
            myself have sworn never to lay eyes on the Nailsage again. Not until I have truly
            mastered his teachings.&lt;page&gt;But if you see him again, please... let him know that
            I am forever grateful.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_GREET">So, your travels have brought you back. What have you learnt? How
            have you grown?&lt;page&gt;Myself? I am still trying to capture something with my
            brush... although I&#39;m not quite sure what that thing is.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_REPEAT">I have spare brushes and plenty of paint. Once you tire of the

        <entry name="MATO_REFUSE">My pupil, why do you hesitate? Do you think yourself unworthy of
            my Nail Art?&lt;page&gt;Do not fret. I too was once like you, unsure of my own strength.
            Stay here with me and meditate, and once you are ready we can begin the lesson.</entry>

            tell you why I chose to tread this path.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_MATO">That Nail Art you&#39;ve learnt, the Cyclone Slash. That was always
            Mato&#39;s favourite.&lt;page&gt;It must have made him ecstatic to have a pupil like
            you. He always wanted to pass down what he&#39;d learnt to a new
            generation.&lt;page&gt;He was not the most skilled pupil himself, but his enthusiasm and
            his kindness set him apart. I&#39;m glad he achieved what he desired for so long. To be
            a teacher...</entry>
        <entry name="ORO_SHEO">I see you&#39;ve been taught a Nail Art by my brother Sheo. How
            fortunate of you.&lt;page&gt;Yes, he was the mightiest of the Great Nailsage&#39;s
            pupils, far outshining Mato and myself. My brother and my master loved him very
            much.&lt;page&gt;He was always aloof, but... not unkind. When we last spoke, he said he
            was going to teach himself something completely new. I wonder if he achieved that
            goal.</entry>
        <entry name="MATO_ART">Ah, I can see it in your eyes - you&#39;re ready to learn my Nail
            Art! Shall we begin the lesson immediately?</entry>
        <entry name="MATO_SHEO">Ah! So my brother Sheo has taught you his Nail Art, the Great Slash!
            How lucky you are to have trained with him!&lt;page&gt;Sheo and I were very close when
            we trained together under the Great Nailsage. He often spoke of becoming tired of the
            Nail Arts and wanting to try something new.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m glad to see he changed
            his mind and continues to bear the proud title of Nailmaster along with me!</entry>
        <entry name="MATO_BOW">You honour me beyond words, my pupil...&lt;page&gt;Thank you.</entry>
        <entry name="MATO_GREET">My pupil, you have come to visit your old master! This is an honour
            I scarcely deserve.&lt;page&gt;Please, sit. You are always welcome to meditate here with
            me.</entry>
        <entry name="MATO_DREAM">My brother, Sheo... how fare you in that green kingdom of thorns
            you call home? I think of you every time I raise my nail...&lt;page&gt;Do you ever close
            your eyes and remember the time we spent together with Oro and our master? I like to
            think you do...</entry>
        <entry name="MATO_ORO">That Nail Art, the Dash Slash... learnt from my brother Oro, was it
            not?&lt;page&gt;So he is still alive then. Hm. I still haven&#39;t forgotten what he
            owes me and I never will.&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t bother you with
            such things. I&#39;m happy that you were able to train under another Nailmaster and grow
            stronger, my pupil.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_NAILSMITH">Oh, look who&#39;s joined us! We have quite a merry crowd now,
            don&#39;t we?&lt;page&gt;This fellow came wandering in to my hut, quite distraught and
            on his own quest for a new calling in life.&lt;page&gt;We talked, and found a common
            love of creating and building and honing a craft. So now we make art
            together!&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s good to have company, I hadn&#39;t realised how lonely I
            was. It&#39;s like being with my brothers again! Stay with us, if you like!</entry>
        <entry name="ORO_ART">So what will it be, traveller? Will you pay the price asked of you, or
            will you leave this place unenlightened?</entry>
        <entry name="ORO_MATO">That Nail Art... you have been training with my brother
            Mato.&lt;page&gt;He has strange notions of loyalty and honour. I&#39;m sure he was
            difficult and unpleasant to train under.&lt;page&gt;Did he mention my name to you? If he
            does, tell him to be patient. He&#39;ll be waiting a while longer before I give him what
            he wants.</entry>
        <entry name="ORO_SLY">That charm you bear... It seems the Great Nailsage has deemed you
            skilled enough in the Nail Arts to earn his highest esteem.&lt;page&gt;I do not begrudge
            you his love. You have earned it.&lt;page&gt;And perhaps by helping you along your path,
            I have redeemed myself... if only a little.</entry>
        <entry name="ORO_MEET">Hmph. How did you find me, down here where the world
            ends?&lt;page&gt;Yes, I know why you&#39;re here. You came to learn a Nail Art from the
            legendary Nailmaster Oro.&lt;page&gt;It is the law of the Great Nailsage that I must
            pass down my teachings to those who are worthy.&lt;page&gt;But no law forbids me from
            exacting a payment for my time. If you truly wish to train under me, prove it with
            Geo!</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_DREAM">My brother, Oro... what drove you to hide away deep down at the
            very edge of that ash swept grave?&lt;page&gt;Was it pride, or fear, or shame? Perhaps
            you should lay down your nail if it haunts you so, and find a new calling that eases
            your soul.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_ART">Something about your bearing... I feel as though you haven&#39;t yet
            abandoned the way of the nail. I can teach you something, if you like... </entry>
        <entry name="MATO_MEET">Hm? Ah, well met! Yes, I thought I could sense the aura of a fierce
            warrior approaching.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m impressed you found my sanctuary here at the top
            of the world. No doubt you&#39;ve endured many trials and overcome many foes in your
            quest to find me.&lt;page&gt;No, don&#39;t speak a word. I, Nailmaster Mato, who was
            taught the Art of the Nail by the Great Nailsage himself, hereby accept you as my pupil!
            Let us begin the lesson immediately!</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_REFUSE">Oh? Have you, too, grown weary of the weight of a nail? I
            understand. Stay, if you like, and we can make art together.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_MEET">A visitor! Why have you crept in here, little grub? Perhaps, like
            me, you have a taste for discovering new things?&lt;page&gt;I am Sheo, and in a previous
            life I was a Nailmaster. Yes, the only thing that drove me was becoming stronger and
            honing my skills with a nail.&lt;page&gt;I imagined it was my one calling in life, but
            that feeling faded over time. Now I seek a new calling, something that speaks to my soul
            and compels me forward.&lt;page&gt;That&#39;s why I spend my time here, secluded, trying
            to master the art of creation. Painting, sculpting... these things bring a different
            kind of pleasure.&lt;page&gt;Mmm. You don&#39;t seem very moved by what I&#39;ve said.
            Was it Sheo the Nailmaster you were looking for? Did you come to learn a Nail Art?
            I&#39;ll teach you if you insist...</entry>
        <entry name="MATO_TAUGHT">Your form... exquisite! Now I know how my own master felt when he
            passed down his teachings to us.&lt;page&gt;I hope you don&#39;t think me too forward
            when I say that I consider you to be my child. Yes! When I saw you perform my Nail Art I
            felt a bond between us suddenly flash into existence!&lt;page&gt;You honour me beyond
            words, my pupil...&lt;page&gt;Thank you.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_ORO">So you met my brother Oro and convinced him to teach you his Nail
            Art. Hmm.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen him. I wonder how
            much he&#39;s changed. He always seemed to be haunted by something, though I never
            learned what.&lt;page&gt;No matter the distance between us though, we are still
            brothers. I hope that passing down his learnings to you brought him some
            happiness.</entry>
        <entry name="SHEO_TAUGHT">So! My work, does it move you?&lt;page&gt;The wielding of a nail,
            the wielding of a brush... these things are not so different.&lt;page&gt;We cut into the
            world so that we can peer deeper inside.&lt;page&gt;For now though, I have nothing more
            to teach you. Your path forwards... only you can see it. Good luck.</entry>

            coincidence we arrive together. &lt;page&gt;Though much of my memory is blank, this
            place I recall.&lt;page&gt;Within these chambers the Teacher sought to store the
            Kingdom&#39;s knowledge and at its core, she stored herself.</entry>
        <entry name="DREAM_SLUGSHRINE">That lake... a revered presence once slept deep
            within...&lt;page&gt;Did it? What would make me think such things?</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_GREENPATH_2">I saw a strange fellow out there. He seemed quite taken by
            the lake.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d planned to offer greetings, though figured I&#39;d first
            tend to my nail on chance our meeting goes poorly. </entry>
        <entry name="DREAM_SPA">This one too must seek the village at the nest&#39;s heart. What

        <entry name="QUIRREL_MEET_TEMPLE">Hello there! How delightful to meet another traveller on
            these forgotten roads.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re a short one, but you&#39;ve a strong look
            about you.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_SPA">Hello, hello! What a thrill this is, to find such warm comfort
            amidst the den of beasts.&lt;page&gt;This is a ferocious place no doubt. Supposedly,
            there&#39;s a village deep in the warren. Its inhabitants never accepted
            Hallownest&#39;s King.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_QUEENSTATION_01">Isn&#39;t this something. I&#39;d not expected to
            discover so huge a Stag Station after that foggy descent.&lt;page&gt;The bugs of
            Hallownest must&#39;ve been an impressive lot, building such grand structures so far
            into these wilds.&lt;page&gt;Seems the dangerous creatures about haven&#39;t yet made
            their way in here. It&#39;s the perfect place for a quick rest.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_NODREAMNAIL">Ahh, but her mind is still locked to you. That final,
            powerful protection stays in place.&lt;page&gt;If you would attempt to break her seal,
            you&#39;ve first to discover the means to open a mind. Such tools may exist to perform
            the feat, though in my own travels I&#39;ve not come across one.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d
            heard it told the Kingdom&#39;s moths did delve amongst dreams and the dead. Perhaps
            you&#39;d seek them out?</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_GREENPATH_REPEAT">Hallownest is perfect for vigilant explorers like us.
            So tense and thrilling. In this place, you&#39;re either alert or you&#39;re
            dead.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_TEACHER_1C">She called me here, now, to reverse that protection. All in
            aid of you.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_TEACHER_1B">To save Hallownest, the Teacher willingly became a seal,
            but upon herself she enacted an additional protection.&lt;page&gt;Though I cannot recall
            its happening, I played a part in that feat.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_RUINS_4">Isn&#39;t this a wonderful spot for a rest? I so love the
            sound of the rain upon glass.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_TEMPLE_6">Truly a marvel...</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_RUINS_1">The capital lies before us my friend. What a sombre place it
            seems and one that holds the answers to many a mystery.&lt;page&gt;I too have felt the
            pull of this place, though now I sit before it I find myself hesitant to
            descend.&lt;page&gt;Is it fear I wonder, or something else that holds me back? </entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_RUINS_2">The city looks to be built into an enormous cavern, and the
            rain pours down from cracks in the stone above.&lt;page&gt;There must be a lot of water
            up there somewhere. I suppose, if the cave roof stayed strong this long, it should hold
            for us.&lt;page&gt;Before I leave this Kingdom, I&#39;d like to see where all that water
            comes from. What a sight it must be!</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_RUINS_3">If you look down from here, through the rain, you can just
            make out those twisted sentries, their husks still stuck in endless
            patrol.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d be cautious around them my short friend. Their training will
            not have been forgotten. This city presents some formidable foes.</entry>

        <entry name="QUIRREL_FOGCANYON_A">Doesn&#39;t this kingdom just abound with surprises? A
            building atop an acid lake.&lt;page&gt;Despite the sight, I can&#39;t help but feel...
            familiarity? Something stirs in my mind, though I can&#39;t yet tell
            what..&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d thought it my lust for discovery that led me here but now
            there seems something else.&lt;page&gt;This building beckons me.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_TEMPLE_4">To persevere in this ruin, that old nail alone just won&#39;t
            be enough. Though that&#39;s no problem! One only has to look around.&lt;page&gt;Plenty
            have come before us and most have met their grisly end, many more equipped than you and
            I.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind were a fellow explorer to relieve them
            of their tools. It&#39;s a kindness really. The dead shouldn&#39;t be burdened with such
            things.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_MINES_4">So small it seems...</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_MANTIS_REPEAT">My own route takes me towards that great city. If you

        <entry name="QUIRREL_MINES_1">Ahh, quite a view, no?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m not surprised you
            survived the trek through these shimmering caverns.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an air of
            strength about you. I suspect it would be quite intimidating, if not for your small
            stature.</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_MINES_2">Did it sadden you to see those miners below, still labouring
            at their endless task?&lt;page&gt;Even overcome, strong purpose has been imprinted upon
            their husks.&lt;page&gt;The crystal ore is said to contain a sort of energy, not as
            powerful as the soul the city dwellers harnessed but far less
            lethal.&lt;page&gt;...Strange to know such ancient facts. I wonder from where my
            knowledge comes?</entry>
        <entry name="QUIRREL_MINES_3">At this high vantage I can just make it out, the light from
            that sad little town.&lt;page&gt;I doubt its residents could even comprehend the scale
            of the world that surrounds them.</entry>

            close and she too believed you capable.&lt;page&gt;Be on your journey then, and allow me
            rest a time. With the deed complete, I begin to feel my age.</entry>

            the first experience from me, I&#39;m thankful I could witness its beauty
            again.&lt;page&gt;Hallownest is a vast and wondrous thing, but with as many wonders as
            it holds, I&#39;ve seen none quite so intriguing as you.&lt;page&gt;Ha. My flattery

            have found so many.&lt;page&gt;An egg is a perfect protective form. In Hallownest we use
            stone journals or tablets, our text engraved atop. These eggs are far more secure. Their
            records are stored within.&lt;page&gt;In fear of damaging the eggs, I&#39;m only able to
            access the outer layer, but it&#39;s clear those in the distant past could somehow
            access information stored even deeper within.&lt;page&gt;If only I could find a way to
            do so. Just think of the discoveries to be made!</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_DOOR">Gone out to clear my head. Will be back soon. If you have

            relics are the prize of my profession. There&#39;s knowledge hidden within, though
            it&#39;s very difficult, painstaking work to extract.&lt;page&gt;One large understanding
            can be gleaned though. This civilisation may claim itself the first, but something else
            did exist within this place before Hallownest.&lt;page&gt;Each egg offers a narrow
            glimpse into that forgotten age.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS">Hm. Looks like you don&#39;t have any relics on you. If
            you manage to find any in good condition, bring them to me and I&#39;ll give you a fair
            amount of Geo for them.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_5">Yep, that&#39;s another Hallownest Seal
            alright.&lt;page&gt;The shop&#39;ll be overflowing with these things soon. Gah! I&#39;d
            never guessed so many would still be lying around.&lt;page&gt;If they&#39;re as common
            as you make them seem, maybe I&#39;ve been offering too much for them?</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_1">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal, eh?&lt;page&gt;Though
            they&#39;re common finds about the kingdom, I much enjoy the deciphering of their
            text.&lt;page&gt;Read together they paint a morbid tale. It seems fate was unkind to
            most who travel within Hallownest&#39;s ruin.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_7">A Hallownest Seal?&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re a talented

        <entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_2">A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;If you look closely, each of
            these idols is subtly different. There are fine engravings about them that take some
            time to decipher.&lt;page&gt;I suspect each was tailored to the owner. A personalised
            symbol of the king&#39;s omnipotence.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN_REPEAT">I&#39;ll be getting back to the shop soon. If I

        <entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_5">A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;With as many of these as
            you&#39;ve delivered, the other Relic Seekers are like to think I&#39;ve gone mad for
            the King!&lt;page&gt;Pah! Who am I kidding. They&#39;ll only be jealous of my
            collection. Find me more!</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_4">A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered the
            true visage of the king. Depictions are of an imposing, gleaming figure and a fiercely
            horned crown.&lt;page&gt;I suspect there&#39;s much embellishment in the imagery though.
            A ruler seeking worship tends to hide their blemishes. It&#39;d do no good to appear a
            common bug.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_3">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal? Yes. Yes. I&#39;ll add it to
            the pile with the others.&lt;page&gt;I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll get to decipher this
            one. It&#39;s long hard work translating the many languages of the bugs that explore
            these caverns.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_2">Another Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;I might not
            offer a lot for each but they&#39;re plentiful about the caverns and I doubt you&#39;ll
            find another willing to make trade for Geo.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_5">Another Wanderer&#39;s Journal, eh?&lt;page&gt;This
            journal is of traditional stone type. Text endures well upon it.&lt;page&gt;In its
            declining age, this city switched from stone to parchment woven of spider&#39;s
            silk.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a small tragedy, but the moisture in these towers has rendered
            most of those texts illegible. </entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_4">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve a knack

        <entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_1">A King&#39;s Idol, eh?&lt;page&gt;Hallownest&#39;s king was
            an elusive figure, deified by the citizens. With the king rarely seen, worship was
            offered through these idols.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an expert craft to them. Few alive
            could match this skill.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_1">A Hallownest Seal, eh? Very interesting this.&lt;page&gt;Do
            you know of the Kingdom&#39;s five great knights? They&#39;re revered figures of
            Hallownest, often mentioned in the annals of the Kingdom, but only as a
            group.&lt;page&gt;Both their names and appearance seem to have been expunged from
            history.&lt;page&gt;So long has passed since their time. It&#39;d be a grand achievement

            nothing left.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a strange thing though. There are no signs of conflict

        <entry name="RELICDEALER_TALK_REPEAT">We&#39;ve talked enough I think. Relics need cleaning.

            there&#39;s a statue out by the city&#39;s entrance depicting a large knightly figure.
            Could be one of the Kingdom&#39;s great five.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d have looked it over
            myself, but the gate&#39;s long been shut tight and it&#39;s too much hassle taking the

            there was an important one. The plaque here mentions its &#39;sacrifice,&#39; which
            carries something of an ominous tone.&lt;page&gt;Probably met some sort of horrible end,
            though it sounds like the knight&#39;s goal may have been achieved in the

            hunt down that old Nailsmith.&lt;page&gt;His hut&#39;s on the outskirts of the city. Not
            that far from here. He might help add some sting to your weapon, provided he&#39;s

        <entry name="RELICDEALER_SHOP_INTRO">Aye Aye. Come searching for rare items have you? Well
            hands off! This collection is mine and I won&#39;t be selling to grubby little
            wanderers.&lt;page&gt;Still, I imagine you come across many interesting items in your
            travels. Maybe you&#39;d care to part with some? I&#39;ll offer a fair trade for
            each.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_CONVO_1">No touching the antiques! My stock is not for
            sale.&lt;page&gt;Still, if you&#39;ve managed to come upon any interesting trinkets
            during your travels, I may be willing to trade. Step over to the counter here and
            I&#39;ll see what you&#39;ve got.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS_2">Not carrying any relics with you? Go find some for me.
            I&#39;ll pay good Geo for nice items.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_EGG_4">A fourth Arcane Egg! I wouldn&#39;t have believed it
            possible. I&#39;ve never met a bug with your knack for uncovering this Kingdom&#39;s
            treasures.&lt;page&gt;You must have some sort of sense about you? Or maybe these eggs
            are somehow drawn to you.&lt;page&gt;My fellows have claimed there&#39;s a will of sorts
            within each egg, that each seeks its own bearer, or reject them.&lt;page&gt;That&#39;d
            be a subtle power indeed, and I remain sceptical. Relic Seekers are prone to confusing
            facts with fable.</entry>
        <entry name="RELICDEALER_EGG_2">Another Arcane Egg?&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a rare chance to own
            two of these. I&#39;ll be the envy of all my colleagues, though my purse is feeling much
            lighter for it.&lt;page&gt;These eggs are the most desired find from time before
            Hallownest, but they&#39;re not the only remnant of that age.&lt;page&gt;You may have
            come upon them, those old statues that seem a store for soul? They too prove its

            Perhaps the reason you&#39;ve found me is because you need my help?&lt;page&gt;Say no
            more, friend. I&#39;m going to give you a gift, a nasty little spell of my own creation.

            are a surprising one, ohoho!&lt;page&gt;Actually, I wanted to ask a small favour of you.
            You see, there is a certain creature lurking just above us, in the heart of this
            temple...&lt;page&gt;...Oho? Well, yet another surprise! You&#39;ve slain that creature
            before I&#39;ve even asked!&lt;page&gt;I scarcely deserve such a friend as you!
            You&#39;re a marvel! Ohohoho!</entry>

            beast!&lt;page&gt;The poor thing! It must have been terrified of you. It used to be
            quite docile, but the rancid air in these caverns filled it with some ancient
            rage.&lt;page&gt;Still, you did what had to be done! You have my gratitude! Of course,
            we both know you wouldn&#39;t have made it through without that spell of mine...

            You didn&#39;t perchance visit my fourth aunt?&lt;page&gt;She makes her home beside that

            You&#39;re a marvel. Your essence has melded with the spell.&lt;page&gt;You must have
            found a powerful source to transform it in such a unique, expressive way.</entry>

            seem to have slipped away myself! Ohohoho!&lt;page&gt;Now we&#39;re awake, I was
            wondering whether you would do me a small favour. Not as repayment for my gift of
            course, simply because we&#39;re now friends.&lt;page&gt;You see, a horrid great beast
            has made its home in the heart of this temple. Such disrespect! I would be quite
            grateful if you were to venture deeper in and slay it for me.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a
            hardy creature, but with your new power you&#39;re more than a match for it! Good luck
            with this small favour, my friend! Ohohohohohoho!</entry>
        <entry name="SHAMAN_TRAPPED_2">What is it? Are you wondering about this gate between us?
            Ohoho! It&#39;s a curious thing, but this door will not open until you have slain that

            for our late Queen.&lt;page&gt;Even as overgrown as they&#39;ve become, these gardens
            are still beautiful after all this time. I&#39;m sure the Queen would be happy to know

        <entry name="STAG_HOPE_1">What do you think of my old home, little one?&lt;page&gt;It was
            full of life, once. Stags coming and going, swapping stories of the places they&#39;d
            been and the passengers they&#39;d met.&lt;page&gt;For a long time now, I&#39;ve
            considered myself the only one remaining. The last stag.&lt;page&gt;But being in the
            Nest again... there&#39;s something in the air. A smell, or a warmth, or a presence
            perhaps?&lt;page&gt;Could it be, other stags have made their way out into the wider
            world?</entry>
        <entry name="STAG_REMEMBER_3">Little one! I&#39;ve found it! The Stag Nest, where I was born

            where I am called, but if you wished to see it yourself, I could take you
            there.&lt;page&gt;None may remain to welcome us, but the nest is still a sight to

            was born and raised. I&#39;d thought its location lost to my failing mind, but now I can
            almost remember the path.&lt;page&gt;If you keep opening stag stations and beckoning me
            through them, perhaps I&#39;ll again find that Nest. Ahh, I would like that very
            much!</entry>
        <entry name="STAG_HOPE_2">Yes, I will hold onto that hope. My kin, still alive, still out

            have important work to do. I will be your companion as long as my old body still

            travelled so deep. You&#39;ve discovered something quite astounding, little
            one!&lt;page&gt;No matter how old I grow, the world still keeps surprises like this
            stowed away...</entry>
        <entry name="STAG_MEET">Greetings, little one! It&#39;s been an age since I last heard the
            ringing of a station bell. It echoed down the stagways and called me to
            you.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve grown stiff and tired over these many years and I&#39;ve
            forgotten much, but the sound of the bell will always call me back.&lt;page&gt;These
            stagways stretch the depths of Hallownest. If you want to travel them, hail me from the
            platform. I will take you where you need to go.</entry>
        <entry name="STAG_RESTINGGROUNDS">The Resting Grounds... Passengers would come here to
            conduct rituals for those who had passed on.&lt;page&gt;Not any more though. Perhaps the
            dead conduct their own rituals now?</entry>
        <entry name="STAG_REMEMBER_1">You&#39;ve opened several stag stations now, haven&#39;t you?
            I&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to once more travel through the
            kingdom.&lt;page&gt;As I visit more places I feel my memories returning to me, like the
            stagways of my mind are running once more.&lt;page&gt;Continue to open the stations and
            you&#39;ll have my deepest gratitude.</entry>

        <entry name="STAG_FUNGUS">Ahh, this gladdens me. The Queen&#39;s Station has opened once
            more. This place was a bustling hub of travel, well-placed for travellers visiting the
            outer edges of the land.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re quite the explorer to find this
            place.</entry>
        <entry name="STAG_RUINS1">I remember this station well. A common trip it was. Goods from all
            over the kingdom were transported here.&lt;page&gt;Not a lot was sent back the other way
            though.</entry>
        <entry name="STAG_GREENPATH">My, this place is much changed since I last saw it. The
            greenery grows so wild the station&#39;s like to be consumed by it.</entry>

            Slowly&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Your body is a delicate thing and you must fuel it with great

        <entry name="PRECEPT_4">Precept Four: &#39;Forget Your Past&#39;.&lt;page&gt;The past is

        <entry name="PRECEPT_2">Precept Two: &#39;Never Let Them Laugh at You&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fools
            laugh at everything, even at their superiors. But beware, laughter isn&#39;t harmless!
            Laughter spreads like a disease, and soon everyone is laughing at you.&lt;page&gt;You
            need to strike at the source of this perverse merriment quickly to stop it from
            spreading.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_3">Precept Three: &#39;Always Be Rested&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fighting and

            Others&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Every creature keeps their desires locked up inside of
            themselves. If you catch a glimpse of another&#39;s desires, resist the urge to claim
            them as your own. It will not lead you to happiness.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_23">Precept Twenty-Three: &#39;Identify the Foe&#39;s Weak
            Point&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Every foe you encounter has a weak point, such as a crack in
            their shell or being asleep. You must constantly be alert and scrutinising your enemy to
            detect their weakness!</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_33">Precept Thirty-Three: &#39;Show the Enemy No
            Respect&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Being gallant to your enemies is no virtue! If someone opposes
            you, they don&#39;t deserve respect or kindness or mercy.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_13">Precept Thirteen: &#39;Never Be Afraid&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fear can

            Strength&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Others may doubt you, but there&#39;s someone you can always

            destroyed.&lt;page&gt;Very well then. Zote the Mighty will grant them their
            desire...</entry>
        <entry name="ZOTE_BUZZER_1">Just what do you think you&#39;re doing?! You dare to come
            between me and my prey? Is it a habit of yours to scurry about, getting in the way and
            causing bother?</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_45">Precept Forty-Five: &#39;One Thing Is Not
            Another&#39;.&lt;page&gt;This one should be obvious, but I&#39;ve had others try to
            argue that one thing, which is clearly what it is and not something else, is actually
            some other thing, which it isn&#39;t. Stay on your guard!</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_55">Precept Fifty-Five: &#39;Bow to No-one&#39;.&lt;page&gt;There are
            those in this world who would impose their will on others. They claim ownership over
            your food, your land, your body, and even your thoughts!&lt;page&gt;They have done
            nothing to earn these things. Never bow to them, and make sure to disobey their
            commands.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_25">Precept Twenty-Five: &#39;Protect Your Own Weak
            Point&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Be aware that your foe will try to identify your weak point, so
            you must protect it. The best protection? Never having a weak point in the first
            place.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_35">Precept Thirty-Five: &#39;Up is Up, Down is
            Down&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If you fall over in the darkness, it can be easy to lose your
            bearing and forget which way is up. Keep this precept in mind!</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_15">Precept Fifteen: &#39;One Foe, One Blow&#39;.&lt;page&gt;You should
            only use a single blow to defeat an enemy. Any more is a waste. Also, by counting your
            blows as you fight, you&#39;ll know how many foes you&#39;ve defeated.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_41">Precept Forty-One: &#39;Learn to Detect Lies&#39;.&lt;page&gt;When
            others speak, they usually lie. Scrutinise and question them relentlessly until they
            reveal their deceit.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_51">Precept Fifty-One: &#39;Nothing is Harmless&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Given
            the chance, everything in this world will hurt you. Friends, foes, monsters, uneven
            paths. Be suspicious of them all.</entry>
        <entry name="PRECEPT_1">... but that&#39;s not the only danger I had to overcome in my quest
            for glory! You&#39;ve noticed this trophy, haven&#39;t you? A keepsake from my final,
            triumphant battle deep in the pit below us.&lt;page&gt;Yes, &#39;Life Ender&#39; claimed
            another victim, and the crowd erupted into ecstatic cheering. Cheering that was both
            loud and utterly sincere.&lt;page&gt;To what do I owe my long string of triumphs and
            victories, you ask? As I said earlier, the key is in my personal philosophy, the
            &#39;Fifty-Seven Precepts of Zote&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Particularly relevant here is the
            first precept: &#39;Always Win Your Battles&#39;. As for the other fifty-six precepts?
            Well...</entry>

            Dirt&#39;.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ll get sick if you spend too much time in filthy places.
            If you are staying in someone else&#39;s home, demand the highest level of cleanliness
