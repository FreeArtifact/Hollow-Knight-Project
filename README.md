# Hollow-Knight-Project (WIP)
Welcome to my personal semester project on Hollow Knight.

Hollow Knight is a lore-ridden, bug-infested, platform-jumpin' video game in which you play as this little bug and explore the abandoned *Hallownest*

I aim to encode the Hunter's journal to hopefully gain interesting insights on the mob variety, vitality, and the hunter's perspective.
