                  <p>My dear. A blessing for you. With your
                     excessive patronage and those startling good looks, you've more than earned
                     it. </p>

                  <p>Do you wear a lot of Charms at once? It's a lot
                     of fun isn't it, mixing and matching them to get the perfect combination? I
                     don't know whether you've noticed, but some Charms seem to like each other.
                     Yes! Mmm! When Charms like each other, they shine even brighter and sing
                     even more sweetly! Even more reason to try all sorts of fun and surprising
                     combinations of Charms! Mmmmmmm! You'll show me whenever you have a new
                     favourite, right?</p>

                     hello! Come in, sweetling! Come in and make yourself at home.</p>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_MEET_2:</h2>
                  <p>I'm Salubra, and this is my cosy little Charm
                     store. Did the townfolk out there tell you to come and visit me? Mmm, yes!
                     This is a lovely little village isn't it? Warm and intimate and full of
                     life.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_MEET_3A:</h2>
                  <p>Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes,
                     Charms! I can see you've started your own collection. Very nice! I'll show
                     you some of my own, and you can take one home with you if you like!</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_MEET_3B:</h2>
                  <p>Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes,
                     Charms! I'm surprised a stylish little gadfly like yourself isn't wearing
                     any, actually. Charms are gorgeous, mystical, one-of-a-kind accessories with
                     a spark of power woven into their cores. Just wearing one is enough to
                     change your life! You'll do things you never thought possible! Take a look
                     at some of the Charms I have for sale. You can take one home with you if you
                     like!</p>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_NOSTOCK:</h2>
                  <p>Goodness, goodness. You've gone and bought all
                     my lovely charms! What a stunning, colourful collection you've amassed.
                     Mmmmmm! You're even more the attractive bug, clad in all those wonderful,
                     sparkling things. I may have nothing more to give, but you must come back
                     and visit from time to time. Such a dashing figure frequenting my store. I
                     bet the whole village is jealous. Mmm hmm!</p>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_1:</h2>
                  <p>Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you're building up
                     quite the Charm collection, aren't you? Quite the little connoisseur. I'd
                     bet you'd like to wear more Charms at once, hmm? I've got a special item for
                     sale that I think you'll be very, verrrry interested in! Mmm! </p>

                  <p>Oooohhhh! You flamboyant little gadfly!
                     Your Charm collection has expanded quite a bit, hasn't it? I think it's
                     about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go
                     on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_3:</h2>
                  <p>Oooohhhh! Your charm collection is
                     getting positively enormous! I'm so jealous! I think it's about time you
                     bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil
                     yourself! Mmmm!</p>

                     you, you've collected even more Charms! I think it's about time you bought
                     another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself!
                     Mmmm!</p>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_OVERCHARM:</h2>
                  <p>It's a bit of a sin to wear too many Charms
                     at once, isn't it? Sometimes less is more! Mmmm! Yes, you shouldn't try to
                     cram on more Charms than you can handle. The effect could be positively
                     overwhelming!</p>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>It's rare enough that someone enters my store,
                     but even rarer to meet one so striking! Those impressive horns! That fierce
                     weapon. The air of mystery! Ooooh. It's enough to make me swoon.</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>CHARMSLUG_TRUTH:</h2>
                  <p>My dapper gadfly, would you care to know how
                     charms are made? I don't often tell my customers, what with the truth being
                     a little morbid. But you're a sharp one so you may have guessed already. Few
                     ways a charm appears but mainly it's from final wish, a dying bug's potent
                     desire crystallised into these gorgeous, powerful trinkets. Now don't go
                     getting too sad. There are exceptions of course, and really, it's quite
                     beautiful, makes them all the more precious. Mmhhmm. Just think of all the
                     little bug souls that went into creating your collection! It's like a crowd
                     of strangers in your pouch, or purse, or...err....wherever it is you keep
                     them.</p>
