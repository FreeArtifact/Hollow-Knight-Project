                  <h2>CORNIFER_HOME:</h2>
                  <p>Cornifer's home at last, but look at him, he's
                     exhausted. He always does this, furiously charts a place, then collapses
                     once he's done. He'll be sleeping for some time I imagine, so even with him
                     home, I'm still lost for company. Ahhh, but I do love the bug, even his
                     faults. Seeing his passion for maps, it's something of an inspiration. Corny
                     keeps asking me to join him on his adventures and I've always declined.
                     Maybe next time I should accept the offer?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM:</h2>
                  <p>I'm glad I put down my weapon, this quiet life with Corny
                     makes me a lot happier. It would be nice to stretch my legs again though...
                     sometime soon...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAMTREE:</h2>
                  <p>My husband mentioned some strange roots that grow about
                     the kingdom and suggested I make a pin to mark them. Cornifer thinks my
                     pin's depiction look grander than the sad limp thing he comes across, but I
                     figure, that's not a bad thing. Who'd want to buy a pin of a limp
                     root?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GHOSTPIN:</h2>
                  <p>Corny was telling me of some distinctive graves and
                     shrines about the kingdom. I've made a new pin to represent them. This one
                     was quite challenging to make, and I laboured over the details. It's a nice
                     result so I think it's worth a little more.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREET1:</h2>
                  <p>Of all the places to end up, we've picked this dreary
                     town. I'd thought it a temporary stop, then my husband became obsessed with
                     that old ruin. Now he's spending all his time down there. He argues
                     cartography is sound business, but other than you, who's buying?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET:</h2>
                  <p>Come to buy a map have you? It's really my husband you
                     should be dealing with, but what a surprise! He's headed down below. He'll
                     pop back occasionally to deliver new maps for the store but I do wish he'd
                     spend a little more time up here. I've not much interest in retail myself.
                     Now, let's see what's here for me to sell.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NEW_MAP:</h2>
                  <p>ISELDA_NEW_MAP</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOSTOCK:</h2>
                  <p>After more supplies? You've already bought so much.
                     Unfortunately for now, you've cleaned us out of anything worth selling.
                     Cornifer will no doubt be pleased, though I do wonder what he plans to spend
                     all that Geo on. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Are you enjoying yourself down in the ruins? At times my
                     husband makes Hallownest sound a wonder, but sometimes it seems a ghastly,
                     dangerous place.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TRAMPIN:</h2>
                  <p>Apparently Hallownest has giant metal carriages called
                     trams? Sounds unecessary to me, given those old stag lines that Corny always
                     talks about. Still, I've made a pin to represent a tram station. Might be
                     useful if you're inclined to make your map more detailed. It wasn't too hard
                     to make, so I'm not charging a premium for it.</p>
