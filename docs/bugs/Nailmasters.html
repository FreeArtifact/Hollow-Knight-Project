         <div class="character-content">
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_ART</h2>Ah, I can see it in your eyes - you're ready to learn my Nail
                  Art! Shall we begin the lesson immediately?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_BOW</h2>You honour me beyond words, my pupil... Thank you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_DREAM</h2>My brother, Sheo... how fare you in that green kingdom of
                  thorns you call home? I think of you every time I raise my nail... Do you
                  ever close your eyes and remember the time we spent together with Oro and
                  our master? I like to think you do...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_GREET</h2>My pupil, you have come to visit your old master! This is
                  an honour I scarcely deserve. Please, sit. You are always welcome to
                  meditate here with me.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_MEET</h2>Hm? Ah, well met! Yes, I thought I could sense the aura of a
                  fierce warrior approaching. I'm impressed you found my sanctuary here at the
                  top of the world. No doubt you've endured many trials and overcome many foes
                  in your quest to find me. No, don't speak a word. I, Nailmaster Mato, who
                  was taught the Art of the Nail by the Great Nailsage himself, hereby accept
                  you as my pupil! Let us begin the lesson immediately!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_ORO</h2>That Nail Art, the Dash Slash... learnt from my brother Oro,
                  was it not? So he is still alive then. Hm. I still haven't forgotten what he
                  owes me and I never will. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't bother you with such
                  things. I'm happy that you were able to train under another Nailmaster and
                  grow stronger, my pupil.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_REFUSE</h2>My pupil, why do you hesitate? Do you think yourself
                  unworthy of my Nail Art? Do not fret. I too was once like you, unsure of my
                  own strength. Stay here with me and meditate, and once you are ready we can
                  begin the lesson.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_REPEAT</h2>Before you leave, rest and meditate with me for a while.
                  Your company is always welcome.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_SHEO</h2>Ah! So my brother Sheo has taught you his Nail Art, the
                  Great Slash! How lucky you are to have trained with him! Sheo and I were
                  very close when we trained together under the Great Nailsage. He often spoke
                  of becoming tired of the Nail Arts and wanting to try something new. I'm
                  glad to see he changed his mind and continues to bear the proud title of
                  Nailmaster along with me!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_SLY</h2>That charm...! Could it be?! Only the Great Nailsage himself
                  could have bestowed such a thing! Your achievements humble my own, my pupil.
                  I myself have sworn never to lay eyes on the Nailsage again. Not until I
                  have truly mastered his teachings. But if you see him again, please... let
                  him know that I am forever grateful.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MATO_TAUGHT</h2>Your form... exquisite! Now I know how my own master felt
                  when he passed down his teachings to us. I hope you don't think me too
                  forward when I say that I consider you to be my child. Yes! When I saw you
                  perform my Nail Art I felt a bond between us suddenly flash into existence!
                  You honour me beyond words, my pupil... Thank you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_ART</h2>So what will it be, traveller? Will you pay the price asked of
                  you, or will you leave this place unenlightened?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_BOW</h2>I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world,
                  traveller. Leave me to my solitude.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_DREAM</h2>Brother Mato, in your lonely home at the top of the world...
                  do you still think of me as an enemy? In the future, if you will listen... I
                  will tell you why I chose to tread this path.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_GREET</h2>You've returned, though you were not invited. As my pupil,
                  it is lawful that I allow you rest and shelter, but do not stay longer than
                  you need to.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_MATO</h2>That Nail Art... you have been training with my brother Mato.
                  He has strange notions of loyalty and honour. I'm sure he was difficult and
                  unpleasant to train under. Did he mention my name to you? If he does, tell
                  him to be patient. He'll be waiting a while longer before I give him what he
                  wants.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_MEET</h2>Hmph. How did you find me, down here where the world ends?
                  Yes, I know why you're here. You came to learn a Nail Art from the legendary
                  Nailmaster Oro. It is the law of the Great Nailsage that I must pass down my
                  teachings to those who are worthy. But no law forbids me from exacting a
                  payment for my time. If you truly wish to train under me, prove it with
                  Geo!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_REFUSE</h2>"Those who do not share their strength will never learn."
                  My master used to say that. Substitute "Geo" for "strength" and you'll have
                  my own views on the matter. Begone!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_REPEAT</h2>Rest here if you must, but do not stay longer than you need
                  to.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_SHEO</h2>I see you've been taught a Nail Art by my brother Sheo. How
                  fortunate of you. Yes, he was the mightiest of the Great Nailsage's pupils,
                  far outshining Mato and myself. My brother and my master loved him very
                  much. He was always aloof, but... not unkind. When we last spoke, he said he
                  was going to teach himself something completely new. I wonder if he achieved
                  that goal.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_SLY</h2>That charm you bear... It seems the Great Nailsage has deemed
                  you skilled enough in the Nail Arts to earn his highest esteem. I do not
                  begrudge you his love. You have earned it. And perhaps by helping you along
                  your path, I have redeemed myself... if only a little.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ORO_TAUGHT</h2>Hmph. I must say, you are an excellent pupil. Your skill
                  with the nail, and your thirst to become stronger... you remind me of my
                  brothers. I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world, traveller,
                  and leave me to my solitude.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_ART</h2>Something about your bearing... I feel as though you haven't
                  yet abandoned the way of the nail. I can teach you something, if you like... </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_DREAM</h2>My brother, Oro... what drove you to hide away deep down at
                  the very edge of that ash swept grave? Was it pride, or fear, or shame?
                  Perhaps you should lay down your nail if it haunts you so, and find a new
                  calling that eases your soul.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_GREET</h2>So, your travels have brought you back. What have you
                  learnt? How have you grown? Myself? I am still trying to capture something
                  with my brush... although I'm not quite sure what that thing is.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_MATO</h2>That Nail Art you've learnt, the Cyclone Slash. That was
                  always Mato's favourite. It must have made him ecstatic to have a pupil like
                  you. He always wanted to pass down what he'd learnt to a new generation. He
                  was not the most skilled pupil himself, but his enthusiasm and his kindness
                  set him apart. I'm glad he achieved what he desired for so long. To be a
                  teacher...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_MEET</h2>A visitor! Why have you crept in here, little grub? Perhaps,
                  like me, you have a taste for discovering new things? I am Sheo, and in a
                  previous life I was a Nailmaster. Yes, the only thing that drove me was
                  becoming stronger and honing my skills with a nail. I imagined it was my one
                  calling in life, but that feeling faded over time. Now I seek a new calling,
                  something that speaks to my soul and compels me forward. That's why I spend
                  my time here, secluded, trying to master the art of creation. Painting,
                  sculpting... these things bring a different kind of pleasure. Mmm. You don't
                  seem very moved by what I've said. Was it Sheo the Nailmaster you were
                  looking for? Did you come to learn a Nail Art? I'll teach you if you
                  insist...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_NAILSMITH</h2>Oh, look who's joined us! We have quite a merry crowd
                  now, don't we? This fellow came wandering in to my hut, quite distraught and
                  on his own quest for a new calling in life. We talked, and found a common
                  love of creating and building and honing a craft. So now we make art
                  together! It's good to have company, I hadn't realised how lonely I was.
                  It's like being with my brothers again! Stay with us, if you like!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_ORO</h2>So you met my brother Oro and convinced him to teach you his
                  Nail Art. Hmm. It's been a long time since I've seen him. I wonder how much
                  he's changed. He always seemed to be haunted by something, though I never
                  learned what. No matter the distance between us though, we are still
                  brothers. I hope that passing down his learnings to you brought him some
                  happiness.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_REFUSE</h2>Oh? Have you, too, grown weary of the weight of a nail? I
                  understand. Stay, if you like, and we can make art together.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_REPEAT</h2>I have spare brushes and plenty of paint. Once you tire of
                  the nail, feel free to join me in my art.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_REPEAT_MODEL</h2>Building these models takes patience and a light
                  touch. It's worth it though, seeing the grand old Knights of Hallownest come
                  to life before our eyes. Mighty Hegemol was always my favourite. What a
                  towering figure he was, though surprisingly soft spoken for one so large.
                  They were all impressive in their own right, of course. Fierce Dryya, kindly
                  Isma, mysterious Ze'mer... erm, and the other one.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_SLY</h2>That charm! Only the Great Nailsage could have given that to
                  you... Seeing how strong you've become... it almost makes me want to take up
                  my nail once more. But no, I should stay on my current path and keep working
                  at my art. If the Great Nailsage ever comes by, I want to show him how far
                  I've come.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHEO_TAUGHT</h2>So! My work, does it move you? The wielding of a nail, the
                  wielding of a brush... these things are not so different. We cut into the
                  world so that we can peer deeper inside. For now though, I have nothing more
                  to teach you. Your path forwards... only you can see it. Good luck.</li>
