                  <p>I understand. It's difficult to part with hard won
                     Geo. I'll be here if you change your mind.</p>

                  <p>Still not interested? You're far too hesitant.
                     Make bold decisions and follow them through, that's the trick to seeing your
                     Geo grow. </p>

                  <p>Oh, hang on. You don't have enough Geo to buy an
                     account, sadly. Once you've collected 100 Geo, come straight back and we'll
                     get your account opened up.</p>

                     errr...my vault. Now let's do some banking.</p>

                     might be on your way now then? Y-y-yes, I think that would be
                     b-best...</p>

               <li>
                  <h2>MEET:</h2>
                  <p>Hello there dearie. I was about to close up shop and run,
                     till you came along. I provide a banking service if you're interested.
                     Losing one's Geo is a terrible thing and it's so much more likely if you
                     carry it about on yourself. My vault is much more secure. In all my time as
                     a banker, I've never lost a single Geo! Maybe you'd considered opening an
                     account?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REMEET:</h2>
                  <p>Have you reconsidered opening an account? Losing Geo is a
                     terrible thing. You'll be much more confident out there in the big,
                     dangerous world, knowing it's safe with me.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPA_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Wah? Oh... you- you're back. I just thought, when you
                     left, that was the last I'd... ahh... see of you. It's just... ahh... your
                     Geo issue. You should know, it was a big stress on me as well. Such a stress
                     in fact, that I've left the banking game for good.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPA_MEET:</h2>
                  <p>Oh...A-ah, hello again d-dearie. Fancy running into you
                     he-here. Is it your Geo you're after? We-ll you see, it's ahhhhh. It's a sad
                     thing, but...It's gone. All spent. The cost of running a bank can be high,
                     so I had to charge a somewhat large service fee to your account. Perfectly
                     legitimate, of course. Just part of the whole banking deal...ah ha ha...ha.
                     But...ahh..thank you so much for visiting me, and run along now won't you.
                     If you allow me some privacy, I'll be done here soon. Then you can have the
                     spa all to yourself.</p>

                  <p>...No h-hard feelings, okay?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WITHDRAW:</h2>
                  <p>Thanks for the withdrawal. Don't go spending it all at
                     once!</p>
