                  <h2>ACCT_DECLINE</h2>I understand. It's difficult to part with hard won
                  Geo. I'll be here if you change your mind.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ACCT_DECLINE_AGAIN</h2>Still not interested? You're far too hesitant.
                  Make bold decisions and follow them through, that's the trick to seeing your
                  Geo grow. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ACCT_NOTENOUGH</h2>Oh, hang on. You don't have enough Geo to buy an
                  account, sadly. Once you've collected 100 Geo, come straight back and we'll
                  get your account opened up.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ACCT_OPEN</h2>You're a smart one. Next time some dreadful beastie
                  gets the best of you, you'll be glad to know your Geo's safe within my shel-
                  errr...my vault. Now let's do some banking.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>BALANCE_ZERO</h2>I--I've nothing left...I ahhh, I suppose, ahh, you
                  might be on your way now then? Y-y-yes, I think that would be
                  b-best...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>BALANCE_ZERO_REPEAT</h2>...I think I might j-j-just rest right here a
                  little while. Yes I think that would be best.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CANCEL</h2>Changed your mind? Well, come back any time.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DEPOSIT</h2>Well done dearie! I'll keep your Geo safe. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM</h2>...When next to return to that delightful spa?...The waters
                  so ease the tension in my shell...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM_SPA</h2>...Oohh no... Leave me be, creepy little
                  thing...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FAREWELL</h2>Goodbye then. Stay safe.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREET</h2>Hello dearie! Keen to do some banking?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET</h2>Hello there dearie. I was about to close up shop and run,
                  till you came along. I provide a banking service if you're interested.
                  Losing one's Geo is a terrible thing and it's so much more likely if you
                  carry it about on yourself. My vault is much more secure. In all my time as
                  a banker, I've never lost a single Geo! Maybe you'd considered opening an
                  account?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REMEET</h2>Have you reconsidered opening an account? Losing Geo is a
                  terrible thing. You'll be much more confident out there in the big,
                  dangerous world, knowing it's safe with me.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPA_GREET</h2>Wah? Oh... you- you're back. I just thought, when you
                  left, that was the last I'd... ahh... see of you. It's just... ahh... your
                  Geo issue. You should know, it was a big stress on me as well. Such a stress
                  in fact, that I've left the banking game for good.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPA_MEET</h2>Oh...A-ah, hello again d-dearie. Fancy running into you
                  he-here. Is it your Geo you're after? We-ll you see, it's ahhhhh. It's a sad
                  thing, but...It's gone. All spent. The cost of running a bank can be high,
                  so I had to charge a somewhat large service fee to your account. Perfectly
                  legitimate, of course. Just part of the whole banking deal...ah ha ha...ha.
                  But...ahh..thank you so much for visiting me, and run along now won't you.
                  If you allow me some privacy, I'll be done here soon. Then you can have the
                  spa all to yourself.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPA_REPEAT</h2>...No h-hard feelings, okay?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WITHDRAW</h2>Thanks for the withdrawal. Don't go spending it all at
                  once!</li>
