         <h1>Hunter</h1>
         <div class="character-content">
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>COMPLETE</h2>Your journal... let me see it! Yes... Yes! The Hunter's
                  journal is complete! You have proven yourself a true hunter, a master of
                  killing, and so with great pleasure I will give you the reward you
                  deserve...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>COMPLETE_REPEAT</h2>You have proven yourself a true hunter, a master of
                  killing, and so with great pleasure I will give you the reward you
                  deserve...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CONVO_1</h2>Little squib! You may have overcome a few creatures, but
                  you are only just beginning. Don't delay, descend into the belly of this
                  world and hunt down the life you find!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CONVO_2</h2>Ahhh... I knew I'd seen it right. That hunter's quality.
                  Hallownest's creatures fall in your path. Don't stop now little squib, many
                  more there are to find, and stalk, and kill. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CONVO_3</h2>Ah ha! Your journal grows fat and full. Only those last
                  few, rare beasts remain left to stalk. Search the kingdom's corners.
                  Complete the journal. Earn your well deserved reward...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM</h2>It is stronger even than me... does it know that? Will it
                  return to hunt me...? I hope it tries.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ENTRIES_COMPLETED</h2>So, you've encountered all of the beasts in
                  this land. Impressive! But one task remains, little squib. Keep hunting down
                  creatures until you have deciphered all of my notes! Only then will I
                  recognise you as my fellow Hunter and you shall receive your reward.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GOT_MARK</h2>You have my mark, and you shall be recognised as one of my
                  rare caste. Fellow Hunter, I have nothing else to give you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GOT_REVISIT</h2>Fellow Hunter. You return? You've already proven yourself
                  to me. I'm only biding time a moment, before next my hunt begins. A true
                  Hunter has no home, no kingdom and I'm eager for new prey. You bear the mark
                  now, but that's only the beginning. That mark will become a part of you,
                  will engrave itself deep within, and that yearning to hunt... It will never
                  leave.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET</h2>Tiny squib... You approach fearless. Are you a hunter like
                  me? Do you feel the urge inside, to stalk, to kill, to understand? Then take
                  it! My journal. It will aid you. At first the text may seem difficult to
                  discern, but a learned hunter will come to understand its words. Venture the
                  depths of this land and slay its beasts. Prove yourself worthy to bear the
                  mark of Hunter.</li>
