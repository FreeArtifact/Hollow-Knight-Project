                  <h2>BASEMENT_2:</h2>
                  <p>I have a gift for you, warrior. As a shopkeeper, I
                     admit parting with it for free is rather difficult. But as the Great
                     Nailsage I must recognise your skill. You have mastered the arts of my
                     remaining pupils. Now tradition decrees you too may hold the symbol.</p>

                  <h2>BASEMENT_3:</h2>
                  <p>Wear it proudly, Nailmaster. You shall be the last to
                     receive its like.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>BASEMENT_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Off you go Nailmaster. I've nothing more to give
                     you... Nothing for free at least. I'll be up briefly and eager take your Geo
                     in trade for my precious wares.</p>

                  <h2>DREAM_RUINS:</h2>
                  <p>...Geo. Geo. All the world is Geo. No nail can
                     withstand its might...</p>

                  <h2>GENERIC:</h2>
                  <p>Pockets feeling empty? If you need some more Geo, take a
                     trip into the ruins below us and hunt around. Just take care not to fall
                     into a haze. I won't be coming down to rescue you.</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>GENERIC_NM:</h2>
                  <p>How are your travels, Nailmaster? As time goes by, I'm
                     sure you'll only grow stronger. If you see your fellow Nailmasters again,
                     tell them I carry them in my thoughts always. And that they should come and
                     buy something from their old teacher as a mark of respect.</p>

                  <h2>KEY:</h2>
                  <p>What do you have there? Why, that's the key to my storeroom!
                     I thought I'd lost it for good. Hmm? Did you find it in those old mines
                     perhaps? Very curious. I've no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.
                     Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I can
                     open my old storeroom up, I can sell you some of the rare stock that's been
                     gathering dust in there. These items may be a little time-worn, but they
                     still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... </p>
               </li>

                  <h2>KEY_2:</h2>
                  <p>What do you have there? Why, that's the key to my
                     storeroom! I thought I'd lost it for good. Hmm? Did you find it in those old
                     mines perhaps? Very curious. I've no idea how it ended up in such a remote
                     place. Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I

                     they still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a
                     look... </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MAPPER:</h2>
                  <p>I see they've opened that mapping shop across the way. I
                     suppose a little competition is healthy. Perhaps I should start to sell maps
                     as well... or is that a little aggressive? Heh. All's fair in a world made
                     of Geo.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NAILART:</h2>
                  <p>Hmm, you seem a little different. Something has changed
                     in your bearing. Ah! The way you hold your nail! So you've learnt a Nail
                     Art... Very interesting. I wonder, do you have the passion to continue your
                     training?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NAIL_HONED:</h2>
                  <p>You've found a new nail, then? It looks like a much
                     finer weapon than the last. Hmm? Oh, this is the same nail... but it's been
                     honed! By someone extremely skilled... A nail is an extension of ourselves,
                     it is the instrument by which we shape the world around us. It's a sacred
                     duty to keep its edges sharp. ...Heh, sorry. I shouldn't ramble on like
                     that. Let's talk Geo instead.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOSTOCK_1:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, still looking for something to buy? Is your Geo
                     weighing you down? Unfortunately, you seem to have cleared out everything
                     I'd be willing to part with. Nothing left at all! I think there might be a
                     few old trinkets down in my storeroom, but I lost the key a while ago. So,
                     no more business between us I'm afraid! For now at least. Get out of here
                     and let me spend some quality time with all the Geo you've gifted
                     me.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOSTOCK_2:</h2>
                  <p>Back again? You know I haven't any stock left, yes?
                     You've cleaned me out. Or were you hoping to sneak a peek at my mountain of
                     Geo? Well it's mine now! And fairly traded. </p>
               </li>

                  <h2>RESCUE_1:</h2>
                  <p>...ugghh, Oro you oaf.... You wield your nail... like a
                     club... ...Esmy... how much deeper do we have to go...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RESCUE_2:</h2>
                  <p>Oh! What?! Who are you?! ...I see. This old village.
                     What a strange dream, to have led me down here! If you hadn't found me, I
                     don't think I would've ever woken.</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>RESCUE_3:</h2>
                  <p>I'm Sly. Usually, I live an uneventful life up in
                     Dirtmouth. The air in these ruins doesn't agree with me, so I'd best be
                     getting back. If you return above, come and see me. I'm probably the
                     friendliest face left there, and I can thank you properly for your good
                     deed.</p>

                  <h2>RESCUE_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>You're exploring then? Very brave! Plenty of
                     courageous wanderers have been lost to the hunger of these old caverns. You
                     have your nail though, and I can tell just by looking that you know how to
                     wield it.</p>

                  <h2>SHOP_INTRO:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, hello! I knew we'd meet again. How do you like my
                     cosy little store? I've made myself pretty comfortable here, selling old
                     trinkets to travellers like yourself. If you're planning a trip below, I've
                     several items that may improve your chance of survival.</p>
