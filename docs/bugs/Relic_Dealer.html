                  <p>No touching the antiques! My stock is not for
                     sale. Still, if you've managed to come upon any interesting trinkets during
                     your travels, I may be willing to trade. Step over to the counter here and
                     I'll see what you've got.</p>

                  <p>Urgh! What do you think you're doing, coming
                     into my nice little shop stinking like that?! These relics have been through
                     enough. They don't need you spreading your stench all over them! Crawl back

                  <h2>RELICDEALER_EGG_1:</h2>
                  <p>An Arcane Egg, eh? Now this, this is an ancient
                     thing. These relics are the prize of my profession. There's knowledge hidden
                     within, though it's very difficult, painstaking work to extract. One large
                     understanding can be gleaned though. This civilisation may claim itself the
                     first, but something else did exist within this place before Hallownest.
                     Each egg offers a narrow glimpse into that forgotten age.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_EGG_2:</h2>
                  <p>Another Arcane Egg? It's a rare chance to own
                     two of these. I'll be the envy of all my colleagues, though my purse is
                     feeling much lighter for it. These eggs are the most desired find from time
                     before Hallownest, but they're not the only remnant of that age. You may
                     have come upon them, those old statues that seem a store for soul? They too
                     prove its existence, though in a larger, cruder form. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_EGG_3:</h2>
                  <p>A third Arcane Egg? You're an exceptional
                     explorer to have found so many. An egg is a perfect protective form. In
                     Hallownest we use stone journals or tablets, our text engraved atop. These
                     eggs are far more secure. Their records are stored within. In fear of
                     damaging the eggs, I'm only able to access the outer layer, but it's clear
                     those in the distant past could somehow access information stored even
                     deeper within. If only I could find a way to do so. Just think of the
                     discoveries to be made!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_EGG_4:</h2>
                  <p>A fourth Arcane Egg! I wouldn't have believed
                     it possible. I've never met a bug with your knack for uncovering this
                     Kingdom's treasures. You must have some sort of sense about you? Or maybe
                     these eggs are somehow drawn to you. My fellows have claimed there's a will
                     of sorts within each egg, that each seeks its own bearer, or reject them.
                     That'd be a subtle power indeed, and I remain sceptical. Relic Seekers are
                     prone to confusing facts with fable.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN:</h2>
                  <p>Oh? What are you doing out in this miserable
                     downpour? Impressive fountain isn't it? I'm sure we'd be able to appreciate
                     it more if we weren't both getting drenched. That knight up there was an
                     important one. The plaque here mentions its 'sacrifice,' which carries
                     something of an ominous tone. Probably met some sort of horrible end, though
                     it sounds like the knight's goal may have been achieved in the process In
                     all the relics I've collected, I've yet to find a clue as to what that
                     was.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>I'll be getting back to the shop
                     soon. If I stay out here too long I'll get washed into the Waterways. Come
                     and visit if you like. If you have relics, I mean. I'm not much for
                     chatter.</p>

               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_IDOL_1:</h2>
                  <p>A King's Idol, eh? Hallownest's king was an
                     elusive figure, deified by the citizens. With the king rarely seen, worship
                     was offered through these idols. There's an expert craft to them. Few alive
                     could match this skill.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_IDOL_2:</h2>
                  <p>A King's Idol? If you look closely, each of
                     these idols is subtly different. There are fine engravings about them that
                     take some time to decipher. I suspect each was tailored to the owner. A
                     personalised symbol of the king's omnipotence.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_IDOL_3:</h2>
                  <p>Another King's Idol? Have you visited the
                     remnants of his palace? It's down below this city, in the bedrock of the
                     kingdom. Must've been an impressive sight in its time. Now there's nothing
                     left. It's a strange thing though. There are no signs of conflict around the
                     area. It's as though the whole place just vanished. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_IDOL_4:</h2>
                  <p>A King's Idol? I've often wondered the true
                     visage of the king. Depictions are of an imposing, gleaming figure and a
                     fiercely horned crown. I suspect there's much embellishment in the imagery
                     though. A ruler seeking worship tends to hide their blemishes. It'd do no
                     good to appear a common bug.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RELICDEALER_IDOL_5:</h2>
                  <p>A King's Idol? With as many of these as you've
                     delivered, the other Relic Seekers are like to think I've gone mad for the
                     King! Pah! Who am I kidding. They'll only be jealous of my collection. Find
                     me more!</p>

                  <h2>RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_1:</h2>
                  <p>A Wanderer's Journal, eh? Though they're
                     common finds about the kingdom, I much enjoy the deciphering of their text.
                     Read together they paint a morbid tale. It seems fate was unkind to most who
                     travel within Hallownest's ruin.</p>

                  <p>Another Wanderer's Journal? I might not
                     offer a lot for each but they're plentiful about the caverns and I doubt
                     you'll find another willing to make trade for Geo.</p>

                  <h2>RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_3:</h2>
                  <p>A Wanderer's Journal? Yes. Yes. I'll add it
                     to the pile with the others. I don't know when I'll get to decipher this
                     one. It's long hard work translating the many languages of the bugs that
                     explore these caverns.</p>

                     finding these. Corpses must be frequent on your journey. No doubt your
                     nail's created many more.</p>

                  <p>Another Wanderer's Journal, eh? This
                     journal is of traditional stone type. Text endures well upon it. In its
                     declining age, this city switched from stone to parchment woven of spider's
                     silk. It's a small tragedy, but the moisture in these towers has rendered
                     most of those texts illegible. </p>

                  <p>A Wanderer's Journal? Have you heard that
                     saying about stone journals? If danger lurks close by and your nail has
                     dulled with wear, Just swing your journal at your foes with blunt and deadly

                     many of these now. Once I get around to deciphering them all, I'll be the

                     how many of these you've collected. You must have travelled the breadth of

                     There're cracks all through it. It's as much a relic as the objects in my
                     shop! I've little interest in weapons myself, but it may be an idea to hunt
                     down that old Nailsmith. His hut's on the outskirts of the city. Not that
                     far from here. He might help add some sting to your weapon, provided he's
                     feeling generous. </p>

                     Do you know of the Kingdom's five great knights? They're revered figures of
                     Hallownest, often mentioned in the annals of the Kingdom, but only as a
                     group. Both their names and appearance seem to have been expunged from
                     history. So long has passed since their time. It'd be a grand achievement to
                     discover their identities.</p>

                     enjoy collecting their like, but there's little information to be gleaned of
                     each. Mind you, they do keep a nice shine about them and there's nothing

                     there's a statue out by the city's entrance depicting a large knightly
                     figure. Could be one of the Kingdom's great five. I'd have looked it over
                     myself, but the gate's long been shut tight and it's too much hassle taking
                     the long way round with all those blasted husks about.</p>

                     claw away at the cracks and ruins. Pah! Scavengers and thieves. It's
                     contemptible.</p>

                  <p>Admiring my shop are you? Well I'm no
                     squatter. This place was dead empty when I moved in and there's no one left
                     alive who'd lay claim to the tower. If you fancy yourself a domicile in the
                     city, go find somewhere else, preferably in another building. I'm well
                     content with just my relics. I'm not after neighbours.</p>

                  <p>We've talked enough I think. Relics need
                     cleaning. Texts need deciphering. Out with you! This isn't a museum.</p>
