            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>BLACK_EGG_OPENED</h2>I heard a piercing cry from the well. It echoed
                  about my mind and left me all a daze. I'd say it was a foul beast's death,
                  but this cry sounded different...divine? Has something happened little
                  traveller? No. Don't tell me. If foul events are brewing, it's probably
                  better I don't know.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>BRETTA_RETURNED</h2>That lovely young lass returned to us! I must
                  admit, I'd placed thin odds on her survival. Seems to think very highly of
                  her rescuer, some sort of dashing, warrior type. Barely stopped gushing
                  since she got back. The warrior must have passed down below whilst I was
                  taking my nap. Such a shame. I'd have loved to meet so impressive a
                  bug.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CROSSROADS_INFECTED</h2>Ehhh...A sharp sickly smell has started to
                  drift from the well beside town. I'd thought those depths ominous before,
                  now they seem just dreadful. Whatever horrid curse afflicts this ruin, I'd
                  wager it's grown stronger than ever. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM</h2>To descend into that ruin...Why? Things are so much simpler
                  up here.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM_FLOWER</h2>These petals... so white. Can you see them too...
                  watching me from wherever you are? Perhaps dreams aren't such bad things
                  after all...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DUNG</h2>Can you... smell something? There's suddenly a horrid stench
                  in the air. I swear, the town usually smells much nicer than this. Please
                  accept my humble apology!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FLOWER_ACCEPT</h2>Ah! I can really have it? My, my... I barely know
                  what to say except... thank you! I'd resigned myself to selflessly giving
                  out advice to passers by, without receiving any gratitude in return. Little
                  did I know, one young bug was taking my words to heart and would repay my
                  kindness. And with such a beautiful gift! Ahh. Suddenly, the world seems a
                  little less faded. Thank you, my friend. I will take care of this flower
                  while you're gone, so we can enjoy it together when you return.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FLOWER_DECLINE</h2>Oh. My mistake. Yes. Very foolish of me. I don't
                  know why I thought you'd go to so much effort for a simple old bug.
                  Appreciating others and being considerate... these aren't skills that
                  everyone is born with.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FLOWER_GENERIC</h2>This flower you gave me... when dark thoughts
                  creep into my head I gaze at it and think of you. Why not rest at the bench
                  here for a while? We can enjoy the flower together before you head off
                  again.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FLOWER_REQUEST</h2>Hm? What's that you have there? Ah! What a
                  beautiful flower! I'd never have guessed by looking, but you have
                  surprisingly good taste in flora. Why are you carrying around such an
                  exquisite bloom? Wait... you didn't...? Ahh! This flower is... is it a gift?
                  For me? Are you really giving me something so precious?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FLOWER_REREQUEST</h2>You're still holding onto that exquisite
                  bloom... have you changed your mind? Are you really giving me something so
                  precious?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GENERIC_1</h2>There's something strange about you. I've seen all
                  types pass below, but you... You're almost familiar, though I'm sure we've
                  never met before.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GENERIC_2</h2>Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you
                  it's quite comfortable. There's no better place to collect your thoughts
                  before heading below. Plus I enjoy the company. Not that you seem the
                  talkative sort.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GOSSIP_HINT</h2>It's a sprawling land beneath us. If you're ever
                  feeling lost or would care for some direction, come speak with me. I may be
                  able to suggest a new sight or a new path you'd never before considered.
                  Suprised? Despite my lack of experience, I'm actually quite knowledgeable
                  about the lay of the kingdom below. I've listened to countless stories from
                  travellers and explorers just like yourself. I'm sure you'll have your own
                  grand tale to tell once you're finished down there. Either that or you'll be
                  dead! I'll admit, in Hallownest, the latter is far more common.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_ANCIENT_BASIN</h2>Did you know the caverns continue even below
                  the capital? Few have ventured that deep so the details are scant. Those who
                  made it back told of impossibly old structures and roads formed as though
                  the rock itself possessed a will.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_CITY_OF_TEARS</h2>Hallownest's great capital is what most of you
                  brave types come to see. Thinking to loot its treasures I suppose? It must
                  be brimming with them. The city's right at the centre of the kingdom, though
                  I've heard the gates are sealed, so gaining entry can be difficult. It'd be
                  a rich bug that could return with even a fraction of the wealth inside.
                  Despite my age, I've only seen few who've managed it. Must say something of
                  the dangers about its streets.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_CRYSTAL_PEAK</h2>Did you see that tall cliff beyond the town's
                  graveyard? That's only the base of a much larger peak. There's mines and
                  machinery and all sorts of valuable rock forms inside. Many a traveller
                  through Dirtmouth headed straight for it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_FUNGAL_WASTES</h2>My understanding of Hallownest can be a little
                  vague, but below those leafy caverns is a fungal grove, once home to
                  peaceful creatures not quite bug and not quite plant. Sounds almost worth a
                  visit no? Well there's a downside, the dreadful stench! A noxious odour
                  fills the place. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_GREENPATH</h2>I used to think the kingdom below was all dead
                  cold rock, but I've since been told different. Travellers speak of startling
                  variety in Hallownest's caverns. Even just besides those Crossroads there's
                  meant to be an area filled with leafy greenery. I told those same travellers
                  about the wonderful grasses that grow around the town. They didn't seem
                  impressed. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_RESTING_GROUNDS</h2>Apparently, the many graves of Hallownest
                  are enough to fill an entire network of caverns. Somewhere above the city
                  it's told. Sounds a gloomy sight. Bah, I'm content with our own humble plot.
                  In our boom times, we even had a gravedigger! Not a bad sort he was, though
                  dead now. He, didn't die to the dangers of Hallownest mind you. That one
                  fell into an open grave and couldn't climb out. I found the corpse myself.
                  Dreadful nuisance. I've since had to tend the graves myself.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HISTORY_1</h2>Many used to come, hoping the kingdom would fulfill
                  their desires. Hallownest, it was once called. Supposedly the greatest
                  kingdom there ever was, full of treasures and secrets. Hm. Now it's nothing
                  more than a poisonous tomb full of monsters and madness. Everything fades
                  eventually, I suppose.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HISTORY_2</h2>I hope you aren't too disappointed by our little town,
                  traveller. Though it's now a solemn place, once we were much more welcoming.
                  Entry to the kingdom was forbidden long ago, supposedly after some great
                  calamity. Many gates were closed, but our old well remains as a way to creep
                  back in. Over the years, all kinds used the well to wriggle into the ruins,
                  wanderers, thieves, adventurers. Funny how few ever come back up. Perhaps
                  they find what they're looking for?.. Bah, I'm not so naive. No doubt,
                  they've all been gobbled up! There are countless dangers in those
                  depths.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>INTRO_MAIN</h2>The other residents, they've all disappeared. Headed
                  down that well, one by one, into the caverns below. Used to be there was a
                  great kingdom beneath our town. It's long fell to ruin, yet it still draws
                  folks into its depths. Wealth, glory, enlightenment, that darkness seems to
                  promise all things. I'm sure you too seek your dreams down there. Well watch
                  out. It's a sickly air that fills the place. Creatures turn mad and
                  travellers are robbed of their memories. Perhaps dreams aren't such great
                  things after all...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>INTRO_NORMAL</h2>Ho there, traveller. I'm afraid there's only me left
                  to offer welcome. Our town's fallen quiet you see.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>INTRO_VISITEDCROSSROAD</h2>Oh! You're back! You walked straight past
                  me and descended down into the ruins without even saying hello! I thought
                  maybe I'd seen a ghost. The mind sometimes plays tricks on you when you
                  spend a lot of time alone.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>INTRO_WALKEDBY</h2>Oh! You came back! You walked straight past me, I
                  thought maybe I'd faded away along with this town.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>JIJI_DOOR</h2>Faring well in your adventures below? Well I had an
                  adventure of my own while you were gone. I don't usually visit the town's
                  graveyard, but I thought I'd go and visit the grave of an old friend. As I
                  was walking amongst the tombstones, I noticed a strange kind of chanting
                  coming from somewhere nearby. Extremely sinister chanting! I looked around
                  to find the source, and I saw two bright, horrible, huge eyes staring at me
                  from the door of a dark cave! I pretended I hadn't heard the voice or seen
                  the eyes and scurried back to town. My friend will have to wait a little
                  longer for her visit...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KINGS_PASS</h2>To reach Dirtmouth, most travellers take circuitous
                  routes around the cliffs beside us. It's a hard trek now but in the
                  kingdom's prime things were far simpler. There's an old pass in the cliffs
                  that once allowed easy access. The bridge up to it has long since crumbled
                  away, and even without it, a huge door bars entry. I can't complain mind
                  you. It's meant we've only ever had to accommodate a trickle of travellers,
                  even during our busiest times. I wouldn't want hordes of bugs to descend on
                  Dirtmouth. I like the quiet.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MAP_SHOP_OPEN</h2>A young couple's just recently taken up residence
                  in the house beside the station. Seems they're running a map shop, which may
                  excite adventurous types like yourself. She's a tall bug, the wife. I told
                  them to take a larger house, especially given they're all empty, but they
                  liked the look of that one. The way she has to bend just to get through the
                  door...I wouldn't put up with it myself.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MINES_LIFT</h2>That noisy old lift, where does it go? Up to the old
                  mines they carved into the peak, I suppose. Have you been up there? Is it
                  true that crystals grow everywhere you step? A villager brought some of
                  those crystals back to the village once. I don't quite understand the allure
                  myself. You can't eat them, and they don't make very good pillows. They
                  hardly seem worth all the trouble to me.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHOPKEEP_RETURNED</h2>Oh, what a turn! Our shopkeep's come home. Just
                  wandered back in. I'd hoped for grand tales of his time below, but he seems
                  to remember almost nothing! Maybe it was all too much for him? If you're
                  interested in his wares, watch out! He drives a hard bargain, that one. No
                  competition. That's the problem. It's bad for the market. Not that he's
                  complaining.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>STAG_STATION_GREET</h2>There’s something about you little traveller.
                  The winds are changing.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>STAG_STATION_REOPENED</h2>I never thought I'd see such a thing. The
                  Stag Station has opened! That building lay silent since before even my time.
                  Oh, I've heard the tales of the glorious lines. A web of tunnels running all
                  through the kingdom. Not that I'll be travelling them, mind you! I'm quite
                  content where I am.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TEMPLE_VISITED</h2>Did you visit that temple? A strange building I've
                  heard, though I'd never dare the journey myself. The braver among us once
                  went there to pray, said they felt at peace within the walls. After a while,
                  they stopped going. I wonder what changed?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TOWN_GREET_3</h2>Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure
                  you it’s quite comfortable. There's no better place to collect your thoughts
                  before heading below. Plus, I'd enjoy the company, even if you're not the
                  most talkative sort.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TOWN_GREET_4</h2>If you do meet my fellows down there you might
                  remind them of their poor Elder, up here, back aching, abandoned to his
                  lonesome vigil. Poor poor me!... Oh I'm fine, really, but a bit of guilt
                  might go some way in persuading their return. Assuming they're still alive
                  that is.</li>
