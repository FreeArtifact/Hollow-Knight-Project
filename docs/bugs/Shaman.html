         <div class="character-content">
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>CRYSTAL_DREAM</h2>...Free...me...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM</h2>Poking around in the dreams of others... You're more
                  curious than you look! Oho ho ho ho!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FIREBALL2</h2>What's this? My vengeful gift has warped within you.
                  You've twisted it into something... else. Ohohohoh! I knew it. My friend!
                  You're a marvel. Your essence has melded with the spell. You must have found
                  a powerful source to transform it in such a unique, expressive way.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FUNG</h2>A corpse overgrown with vegetation.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FUNG_DREAM</h2>...Hear...me...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KILLED_BLOCKER_1</h2>Oho! So it's done then, you've slain the beast!
                  The poor thing! It must have been terrified of you. It used to be quite
                  docile, but the rancid air in these caverns filled it with some ancient
                  rage. Still, you did what had to be done! You have my gratitude! Of course,
                  we both know you wouldn't have made it through without that spell of mine...
                  Ohoho!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KILLED_BLOCKER_2</h2>Oho! There you are! I was watching over you
                  while you slept, and must have slipped away myself. I woke up and found
                  you'd disappeared! You are a surprising one, ohoho! Actually, I wanted to
                  ask a small favour of you. You see, there is a certain creature lurking just
                  above us, in the heart of this temple... ...Oho? Well, yet another surprise!
                  You've slain that creature before I've even asked! I scarcely deserve such a
                  friend as you! You're a marvel! Ohohoho!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET</h2>Oho! Who is that creeping out of the darkness? My, you're
                  looking grim! A strange, empty face and a wicked looking weapon! Something
                  important has drawn you down into Hallownest's corpse, but I won't ask what.
                  Perhaps the reason you've found me is because you need my help? Say no more,
                  friend. I'm going to give you a gift, a nasty little spell of my own
                  creation. It's just perfect for a little one like you! Ohoho!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OPENED_GATE</h2>Why do you hesitate? You'll get nothing more from me,
                  I'm afraid. Though I do admire your persistence! Ohohohoho! </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OPEN_GATE</h2>And look! The gate between us has opened. Ohoho! I'm
                  sure you're eager to move on. Farewell, and have faith! Whatever you are
                  seeking... it will find you! Ohohoho!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUAKE</h2>Ah ho! I'm sensing new power about you, one that'll crack
                  the rock beneath us. A useful thing for one looking to travel ever deeper.
                  My third uncle used to possess similar abilities. He also possessed a
                  ferocious temper! Ohohoho! What a dreadful combination. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUAKE2</h2>My friend. My friend. There's another quality about you
                  yet. You didn't perchance visit my fourth aunt? She makes her home beside
                  that Crystal Mount. Leaves quite an impression on those that seek her out.
                  Were I not bound here, I'd love to visit myself.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RETURN</h2>Oho! What brings you back through here, little shadow? Are
                  you lost? Don't worry about me. I don't need anything more from you.
                  Ohohoho!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SCREAM</h2>Pried a spell out've my larger cousin did you? Aren't you
                  the charming one. She's not usually the generous sort, certainly not as
                  giving as myself, but she does have that wonderful voice! It's no surprise
                  her spells take on such aural force. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SCREAM2</h2>That scream? Ooohh, distorted in such a way... It's not
                  within the skills of us snails to do such a thing. Wherever you draw this
                  new power from, it's not a place my kind ever thought to look.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SUMMONED_1</h2>Don't be afraid. Have faith! That spell belongs to you
                  now, all you need to do is take it! Ohohoho, you won't be going much further
                  without it, I promise you!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SUMMONED_2</h2>Oho, you've come back! Didn't you like the look of my
                  gift? You left without saying a word! Perhaps you're braver than you think!
                  Go ahead and take what belongs to you!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TRAPPED_1</h2>Oho? You've woken at last! I apologise, perhaps I
                  should have warned you about the power of that spell. I was watching over
                  you as you slept, but seem to have slipped away myself! Ohohoho! Now we're
                  awake, I was wondering whether you would do me a small favour. Not as
                  repayment for my gift of course, simply because we're now friends. You see,
                  a horrid great beast has made its home in the heart of this temple. Such
                  disrespect! I would be quite grateful if you were to venture deeper in and
                  slay it for me. It's a hardy creature, but with your new power you're more
                  than a match for it! Good luck with this small favour, my friend!
                  Ohohohohohoho!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TRAPPED_2</h2>What is it? Are you wondering about this gate between
                  us? Ohoho! It's a curious thing, but this door will not open until you have
                  slain that creature lying in the heart of the temple. Don't worry about it.
                  I'm sure the spirits of my ancestors will be watching over you.</li>
