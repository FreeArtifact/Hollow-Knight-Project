                  <h2>NOTE_ABYSS_CRAWLER</h2>This little creeper is weak and poses no threat,
                  but something about it still unsettles me. The way it moves and the noises
                  it makes are... strange somehow.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ABYSS_TENDRIL</h2>The bugs of Hallownest sometimes wondered whether
                  there were other, older, stranger Kingdoms deep below them. What strange
                  fancies they had. That's probably why they were always so distracted and
                  easy to kill.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ACID_FLYER</h2>Thinks itself fully protected and so is unconcerned by
                  passers by. Attack its face, and teach it that nothing is ever safe.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ACID_WALKER</h2>One of the few creatures that can survive in the
                  rivers of harsh acidic water that flow around us. Where does this water come
                  from? It bubbles and spits with a seething hatred of the living...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ANGRY_BUZZER</h2>The infection that passes from creature to creature
                  grants strength and courage, but it also seems to enslave the will. Would
                  you make such a bargain?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BABY_CENTIPEDE</h2>Springy and vicious, these hunters will try to
                  overwhelm you with numbers in the dark, tight, twisting caverns they carve
                  through the ground. Always be on your guard!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BEE</h2>Savage and dedicated warriors. Be prepared to fight them to
                  the death if you plan on invading their home.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BEE_HATCHLING</h2>Weak, but hard-working and numerous. Their hairy
                  little bodies are filled with a thick, sweet, golden liquid. Good to keep a
                  few on you for long hunts.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BIGBUZZER</h2>A filthy creature that is happy to chew on any old
                  thing it finds discarded on the cavern floor. When it notices a threat it
                  will annoyingly scream and shriek, so kill it swiftly.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BIGFLY</h2>Bizarrely, this monster does not lay eggs but instead
                  carries its young inside of its fat stomach. This strange practice seems to
                  exhaust the creature, making it sleepy and vulnerable. Take
                  advantage!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BIG_BEE</h2>Like their smaller kin, their only instinct is to protect
                  the Hive at any cost to themselves. Somewhat clumsy, they'll often damage
                  the structure of the Hive when charging at intruders. Does this cause them
                  shame? I do not know whether they have the capacity for such a
                  thing.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BIG_CENTIPEDE</h2>Monstrously strong, they shrug off any attacks you
                  make on their thickly armoured bodies. Luckily, if you simply avoid their
                  paths they'll leave you alone.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BIG_FAT_FLYER</h2>Too slow to escape you and too large to hide from
                  you. This prey will not challenge you, but sometimes it is good to take
                  things easy.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BLACK_KNIGHT</h2>When these silent warriors fall in battle, their
                  bodies split open and strange bugs come flying out. I wonder, what will come
                  flying out of me when I die? Will my hopes and fears drift away into the
                  darkness?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BLOBBLE</h2>They have crafted a tiny mask for it! Is such an
                  extravagance practical I wonder?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BLOB_FLYER</h2>Does it realise what a nuisance it is? Drifting
                  around, spilling its noxious juices everywhere it goes? If you see any, make
                  sure to kill them.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BLOCKER</h2>As they age, these creatures become too heavy and lumpy
                  to roll around freely. Instead, they curl up and hide from the world. What
                  do they think of in there, wrapped up inside of themselves? More carefree
                  times perhaps.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BOUNCER</h2>They only seem dimly aware of their surroundings, making
                  them easy prey to cut your fangs on. What is it that guides them on their
                  paths? It almost seems like they search for ways to die.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BURSTING_BOUNCER</h2>Horrible goo and noxious gas has started leaking
                  down from above. Is there a source of all this pestilence? If so, I haven't
                  seen it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_BUZZER</h2>This fierce little hunter will bravely chase down
                  creatures many times its size. Admirable! It is weak though, and I have
                  devoured hundreds of them with little effort or care.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_CEILING_DROPPER</h2>An angry creature with no regard for its own
                  life. A creature without fear... can it truly be called "prey"?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_CENTIPEDE_HATCHER</h2>Are these creatures the mothers of the
                  dirtcarvers? They appear only loosely related. But then how do the
                  dirtcarvers get inside of the hatchers? A confusing situation.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_CLIMBER</h2>Spends its time tap-tap-tapping its way through the roads
                  and caverns near the surface of this kingdom. If you're patient, you can
                  wait for it to come to you and pick it off.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_COL_FLYINGSENTRY</h2>What do they hope for, these warriors fighting
                  in the Colosseum? Are they slaves, or prisoners, or do they freely choose to
                  fight?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_COL_HOPPER</h2>They seem fierce, but they have a lot of difficulty
                  aiming at their target. Watch their motions and strike when the opportunity
                  comes. Take their helmet with you as a trophy.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_COL_MINER</h2>You can hit this warrior's spinning weapons out of the
                  air, straight back into them! Useful if they manage to corner you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_COL_MOSQUITO</h2>Strong and quick! When they rear back, either move
                  out of the way or prepare to strike back!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_COL_ROLLER</h2>These creatures... I have never seen one fully grown.
                  I suppose they aren't allowed to live long enough to become adults.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_COL_SHIELD</h2>That 'Colosseum' is a strange place where some bugs
                  fight each other to the death and others watch. I don't understand such
                  obscure rituals. If you venture in, stay on guard at all times.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_COL_WORM</h2>Large, bulky, and fighting for its life. Don't
                  underestimate this fighter! It can slither around quickly despite its bulk.
                  It also has a surprisingly beautiful face beneath its mask.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_CRAWLER</h2>Dull and pathetic. Hardly worth killing.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_CRYS_CRAWLER</h2>Large and well-protected, but slow and docile. The
                  bugs of Hallownest used to force these creatures to carry around their carts
                  and machines.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_CRYS_FLYER</h2>Make their homes all the way up at the top of the
                  world. Do they use the crystals willingly as weapons or are they merely
                  hosts and the crystals parasites?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_CRYS_LAZER_BUG</h2>These creatures look weak, but sometimes burning
                  pillars of heat will burst out from the crystals they carry on their backs.
                  Be wary, and time your strikes well!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_DUNG_DEFENDER</h2>Fighting for 'honour', or for 'loyalty'... you may
                  as well be fighting for dust. If you want to kill, do it for your own sake.
                  That is the nature of a true Hunter.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_EGG_SAC</h2>Easily tracked down if you have a sense of smell. I
                  strongly suggest you do not eat its eggs.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ELEC_MAGE</h2>Supposedly lives on a diet of lumaflies and spends its
                  entire life fighting in the arena or meditating in seclusion. An odd
                  foe.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FALSEKNIGHT</h2>Weak creatures love to steal the strength of others.
                  Their lives are brief and fearful, and they yearn to have the power to
                  dominate those who have dominated them.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FAT_FLUKE</h2>When predators are too successful the surplus food they
                  eat becomes soft bulk wrapped around their bodies. Still, these creatures at
                  least seem to make good use of their additional weight.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FINAL_BOSS</h2>The plague, the infection, the madness that haunts the
                  corpses of Hallownest... the light that screams out from the eyes of this
                  dead Kingdom. What is the source? I suppose mere mortals like myself will
                  never understand.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FLAMEBEARER_LARGE</h2>"Dance and die and live forever, Silent voices
                  shout and sing, Stand before the Troupe's dark heart, Burn away the
                  Nightmare King." - 'The Grimm Troupe'</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FLAMEBEARER_MED</h2>"A spark of red lights darkest dream, Scarlet
                  nightmares bright and wild, Visions dance and flames do speak, Burn the
                  father, feed the child." - 'The Grimm Troupe'</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FLAMEBEARER_SMALL</h2>"Shadows dream of endless fire, Flames devour
                  and embers swoop, One will light the Nightmare Lantern, Call and serve in
                  Grimm's dread Troupe." - 'The Grimm Troupe'</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FLIP_HOPPER</h2>Adaptability is an important survival skill. If a
                  problem seems insurmountable, try approaching it from a different
                  angle.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FLUKEFLY</h2>Seems to want to latch onto any living thing that comes
                  by with its sharp little teeth. It will leave its cousins alone though, so
                  it isn't completely mindless.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FLUKEMAN</h2>Dangerous, unpredictable foes that infest the pipes
                  below Hallownest's capital. Even when it seems you've killed them, you need
                  to stay on guard.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FLUKE_MOTHER</h2>The desire to breed, to leave behind a memory of
                  ourselves in the shape of a child... it seems to be etched deep into the
                  heart of every living creature. I too have felt the pull of that base
                  instinct.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FUNGOON</h2>So round! I don't think I've seen a rounder creature than
                  this. This world certainly hides some marvellous creatures. I must hunt them
                  all down!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FUNGOON_BABY</h2>Just a child, it drifts about with closed eyes and
                  an open mind. When I was young, my brothers and sisters and I would hunt
                  each other in the nest. Now I hunt alone.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FUNG_CRAWLER</h2>Lie on your belly, open your maw and let this tasty
                  morsel stroll straight into your stomach.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_FUNG_ZOMBIE</h2>The bugs of Hallownest are so pathetic that being
                  infected by poisonous fungi actually increases their chances of survival!
                  They really are absurd creatures.</li>
               <li>

               <li>

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GHOST_HU</h2>Never forget what once was lost, yet do not let it tie

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GHOST_MARMU</h2>If you believe in something as hard as you can, with
                  your eyes shut tight... eventually it will come true! - Marmu</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GHOST_NOEYES</h2>They're coming... What's inside of you... Strip it

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GHOST_XERO</h2>A life defined by tragedy and triumph. A death marred
                  by sorrow and regret. A spirit burdened by sins and memories. Better to
                  wander the world than be cursed with glory. - Xero</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GIANT_HOPPER</h2>A worthy foe, surprisngly nimble for its size.
                  Either keep your distance, or try to dance between its hops and strike at
                  its legs.</li>

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GORGEOUS_HUSK</h2>There is beauty in many things. Reflections of
                  light in water, the taste of freshly killed meat, the cry of a hatchling for
                  its mother... I have never understood the lust for metals and stones
                  though.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GRASS_HOPPER</h2>It seems like their energy is limitless! Do they
                  ever stop to sleep, or eat, or love?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GREAT_SHIELD_ZOMBIE</h2>An extremely rare thing, a bug of Hallownest
                  that actually poses a threat. Watch them carefully, as they can lash out
                  quickly with devastating strikes.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GREY_PRINCE</h2>"My love, any creature who could bear to be away from
                  you, who would willingly leave you behind or say unkind things to you...
                  Pah! Lowly maggots, not worthy of standing in your glorious shadow!" She
                  felt her cold body grow warm, a sensation she had almost forgotten... - 'The

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_GRUB_MIMIC</h2>Luring an enemy close by pretending to be a weak
                  little grub. Very cunning! Unfortunately for them, I eat these grubs as soon
                  as I see them.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HATCHER</h2>Shamelessly uses its own young as a weapon against its
                  foes! Appalling, yes, but I do admire its resourcefulness. Good hunters do
                  not always make good parents. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HATCHLING</h2>These hatchlings are born with an instinct to kill!
                  They are still only infants though, and you can crush them between your
                  fangs without thinking. Just don't let them overwhelm you with

                  <h2>NOTE_HEALTH_SCUTTLER</h2>The bright liquid inside of these little fellows
                  is delicious, and drinking it will make you feel stronger. I wonder how my
                  own innards taste... would it be a heinous thing to try and drink
                  some?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HIVE_KNIGHT</h2>Some creatures are born with duties and loyalties
                  marked indelibly upon their minds. They are strong, but they are also
                  slaves.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HOLLOW_KNIGHT</h2>The old King of Hallownest... he must have been
                  desperate to save his crumbling little world. The sacrifices he imposed on
                  others... all for nothing.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HOLLOW_SHADE</h2>Each of us leaves an imprint of something when we
                  die. A stain on the world. I don't know how much longer this kingdom can
                  bear the weight of so many past lives...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HOPPER</h2>This hopping thief's belly is full of the blood it has
                  stolen from other beasts. If you hold it above a fire, the belly will grow
                  and grow until it explodes in a steaming shower of fluids.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HORNET</h2>I have seen this nimble little creature. I thought her
                  prey and pounced at her, but with a flash she stabbed me with her flying
                  stinger and darted away. Could she be... a Hunter?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_HUNTERMARK</h2>I have no offspring, nor subjects, nor worshippers.
                  The sum of my being, my learning, my instincts... I leave it all to you.
                  Good luck, Hunter.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_INFECTED_KNIGHT</h2>The shape of this creature... I have seen
                  something like it before. More than once, perhaps. It looks a little like
                  the bugs of Hallownest, but not quite the same. Where did these empty little
                  wanderers come from?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_INFLATOR</h2>Extremely amusing creature.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_JAR_COLLECTOR</h2>A shadow that sometimes flits through the caverns,
                  making strange noises to itself. I've never seen it clearly so I have no
                  idea what type of creature it is.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_JELLYFISH</h2>Ghastly, eerie creature made out of thick liquid. You
                  can peer right through them, and can't see where they keep their thoughts. I
                  don't trust them at all. Keep away.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_JELLY_CRAWLER</h2>The spirit of a dead ancestor? The brain of a
                  larger creature, allowed to drift free? An egg searching for a safe place to
                  spawn? I have no idea what this is.</li>

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_LESSER_MAWLEK</h2>If you try to keep your distance it will spit
                  sticky, burning globs of vile stomach juice. Move in quickly and strike
                  decisively.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_LOBSTER_LANCER</h2>Some hunters train beasts to join them in chasing
                  down prey. I tried it once, but couldn't resist the urge to test my
                  companion's strength against mine.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MAGE</h2>I have heard others talk about 'soul' but I do not
                  understand what it actually is. I do know that freshly killed meat tastes
                  best - is that because the 'soul' still clings to it?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MAGEBLOB</h2>These fools meddled with the soul of other creatures and
                  lost their shape. Now they skulk through the shadows of their Sanctum like
                  slugs, hoping their old brothers will build them new bodies.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MAGE_BALLOON</h2>I've heard whispers that the secret these fools were
                  searching for was immortality. To live forever... I've never heard of
                  anything so obscene!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MAGE_KNIGHT</h2>Where these strange warriors go, whispers follow
                  them. Not only are they skilled with a nail, they can also use some strange
                  power to shift suddenly from place to place. Stay on guard.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MAGE_LORD</h2>The bugs of Hallownest tried all kinds of tricks and
                  rituals and prayers to rid themselves of the infection. But to no avail!
                  Perhaps the infection came from somewhere deep inside of them that they
                  could not escape.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MANTIS</h2>If you venture too deep into the fungal forests, these
                  warriors will stand in your way. What is it they guard, deep at the bottom
                  of their territory?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MANTIS_FLYER_ADULT</h2>They will harass you from afar, so get close
                  and strike quickly. Their bodies are brittle and will easily fall to your
                  nail.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MANTIS_FLYER_CHILD</h2>As it grows, it loses the ability to fly.
                  Passage into adulthood is often celebrated, but as time goes by we realise
                  what we have lost.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MANTIS_HEAVY</h2>Belonging to a tribe, or not belonging. I don't

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MANTIS_LORD</h2>The Mantis tribe and the bugs of old Hallownest had
                  no love for each other. The Mantises outlived their rivals though, and their
                  civilisation still stands.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MAWLEK</h2>I hear this beast crying out sometimes as I prowl the
                  caverns, although I've never actually laid eyes on it. Who or what is it
                  calling for? As far as I can tell, its voice is never answered.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MAWLEK_TURRET</h2>How did this foolish creature lose its legs?! I
                  suppose it's possible to lose anything, if you really try.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MEGA_BEAM_MINER</h2>How does the world look to this creature, gazing
                  out from within its crystal prison? Does it see only light? Is that what
                  drives it into a frenzy?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MEGA_JELLYFISH</h2>The canyon below us, the one thick with fog and
                  crackling with strange energy... a Hunter can lose their senses down there.
                  Be careful... strange and unnatural things lurk there.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MEGA_MOSS_CHARGER</h2>There is strength in numbers, yes, but these
                  creatures never had much strength to begin with. Cut through their
                  trickery!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MENDERBUG</h2>The bugs of Hallownest were obsessed with building
                  things. What strange little minds they had.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MIMIC_SPIDER</h2>In the deepest darkness, there are beasts who wear
                  faces stolen from your memories and pluck at the strings in your heart. Know
                  yourself, and stay strong.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MINES_CRAWLER</h2>I don't find this creature particularly noteable or
                  interesting. It should learn to fly, or breathe flames, or sing hauntingly.
                  Anything to justify its existence.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MINI_SPIDER</h2>The Deepnest is a dangerous place to hunt, but
                  rewarding. Keep an eye out for weaker creatures you can pick off and eat.
                  Keep your strength up in the darkness.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSQUITO</h2>When they lunge at you, don't panic. Stand your ground,
                  and strike back as they come close.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSSMAN_RUNNER</h2>They can be hard to spot amongst the foliage until
                  you get too close and they suddenly come charging at you. Tread
                  carefully.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSSMAN_SHAKER</h2>The gas that seeps from their growths smells
                  invitingly sweet, but it will burn through shell and flesh if you get too
                  close!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSS_CHARGER</h2>It's small, but it finds a lot of courage and
                  strength once it covers itself in foliage. And I can understand the desire
                  to camouflage oneself...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSS_FLYER</h2>They spend their whole lives hiding or fleeing. How
                  sad. Or, perhaps that is the life they choose for themselves and they enjoy
                  it? It's a strange thought, but not impossible.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSS_KNIGHT</h2>They hide as bush-like mounds and look soft, but
                  beware these warriors! They are relentless in combat, fiercely guarding
                  something hidden deep in the Greenpath.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSS_KNIGHT_FAT</h2>Slow, fat and easily vanquished; common threads
                  in those who forget their calling and forsake their duties.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MOSS_WALKER</h2>I used to think these things were merely ambling
                  plants. When I learned they were actually living creatures, I began to kill
                  them on sight. This is the nature of the Hunt!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MUMMY</h2>Inside these shambling corpses is a bright light that
                  pierces any darkness. I peered inside that light once and saw... something
                  within it shining back. Something terrible.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MUSH_BABY</h2>Looks like an ordinary mushroom until you get close,
                  then it pops out of the ground and starts scurrying around blindly. Very,
                  very amusing.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MUSH_BRAWLER</h2>Are these hulking things beasts or are they
                  mushrooms? I cut one in half and peered inside to find out, but could find
                  no answers in its soft, stinking insides.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MUSH_ROLLER</h2>Something queer in the air has caused these mushrooms
                  to grow hearts, minds, and even faces! This means they now fear for their
                  lives, like all other living creatures.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_MUSH_TURRET</h2>If you're skillful, you can lead their spores back to
                  them and watch them perish in a destruction of their own making. There is a
                  lesson in that, I think.</li>

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_OBLOBBLE</h2>Having a mate by your side... one that will never leave

                  side...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ORANGE_BALLOON</h2>The infection creeping through the Kingdom's dead
                  veins... does it have a mind? Does it produce soul? Is it truly
                  alive?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_PAINTMASTER</h2>"O God inspired, master of arts, Whose works shall

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_PALACE_FLY</h2>The bugs of Hallownest believed that their King
                  created this world and everything in it. For what purpose, I wonder? Were
                  his subjects companions, or toys, or children? Such a mind seems
                  unknowable.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_PALE_LURKER</h2>This odd creature is unaffected by and unaware of the
                  disease drifting through the caverns. Its madness is all its own.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_PARASITE_BLOB</h2>Strange air has been seeping down from above for
                  years. Some of the air became liquid, and some of that liquid became flesh,
                  and some of that flesh came to life. I don't know what to make of
                  it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_PIGEON</h2>They all keep lookout for danger and when one flies away
                  the rest do as well. I wonder how it feels to have the protection of a
                  pack?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_PLANT_SHOOTER</h2>Its leaves are dry and bland. The bud is
                  unpleasantly sour, but oh! The venom in those balls it spits. Exquisite! If
                  you have the time to spare, try drinking some and enjoy the effects.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_PRAYER_SLUG</h2>Consisting mainly of sweet fat, these helpless
                  creatures make excellent provisions for long journeys. Best roasted over
                  open flame. If they try to bargain for their life, just ignore them. They
                  have nothing to offer.</li>

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ROLLER</h2>Younger hunters delight in catching these creatures and
                  rolling them around for sport. I encourage you to indulge yourself if the
                  fancy strikes you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ROYAL_GUARD</h2>They say the old King died long ago, but his
                  influence echoes around us still. A creature like that... what did he
                  desire?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SAGE_SLY</h2>"Sagely God of the cunning and bold, Sharpen Our nails

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SENTRY_1</h2>More skilled at combat than most bugs of Hallownest,

               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SENTRY_FAT</h2>Surprisingly quick-witted for a corpse. It will try to
                  catch you if you leap over it and can chase you if you flee. Enjoyable to
                  hunt, but beware them in packs.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SENTRY_FLYING</h2>Dances through the air just out of reach until it
                  spots an opening, then swoops in for a decisive strike. If you're confident,
                  wait for it to come to you then counter-attack.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SENTRY_FLYING_JAVELIN</h2>This devious foe will often keep its
                  distance and try to pick you off with its thrown weapons. When it charges at
                  you, leap up and strike it down. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SIBLING</h2>Far down below us, beneath the kingdom, the air grows
                  stiller and a sense of emptiness pervades. Can life flourish down there? If
                  so, I will hunt it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SLASH_SPIDER</h2>Powerful, well-armoured and fast, these are no mere
                  beasts. Study their movements and watch carefully for an opening.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SNAPPER_TRAP</h2>You really would have to be a fool to be tricked by
                  a plant.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SPIDER_FLYER</h2>They can appear from the darkness at any moment!
                  They seem to fly through the air, dancing on invisible strings as they
                  silently stalk prey.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SPITTER</h2>Cunning predators that will try to pick you off from a
                  distance. Don't give them any space, just charge in and cut them down!
                  You'll find they're not so cunning once they are dead.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SPITTING_SPIDER</h2>They can be hard to spot as they flitter in and
                  out of the darkness. Watch for their glowing eyes.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_SUPER_SPITTER</h2>These cruel foes will ambush you and relentlessly
                  attack with their searing venom. How strange that their descendants are so
                  weak. If I have children, I hope they will be stronger than me...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_TRAITOR_LORD</h2>I have felt that desire. The desire to take the
                  infection into myself. To become stronger, more powerful... these thoughts
                  haunt my dreams during the darkest times. A false hope, but it can burn so
                  brilliantly in one's mind.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_VOID_IDOL_1</h2>"Inspired or mad, those ancient bugs. They devoted
                  their worship to no lord, or power, or strength, but to the very darkness
                  itself." - Lemm</li>

                  <h2>NOTE_VOID_IDOL_2</h2>"Inspired or mad, those ancient bugs. They devoted

                  <h2>NOTE_VOID_IDOL_3</h2>"Inspired or mad, those ancient bugs. They devoted

                  <h2>NOTE_WHITE_DEFENDER</h2>"The Champion's Call, the Knotted Grove, the
                  Battle of the Blackwyrm... I remember it all. I will carry those glories
                  with me always... until we meet again." - Ogrim of the Five Knights</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_WHITE_ROYAL</h2>Simple, weak creatures find strength by forming a
                  hive and obeying a ruler. Such creatures become the arms and teeth and claws
                  of their monarch.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_WORM</h2>These brutes seem to be impervious to most damage, so you
                  can sharpen your weapons on their thick hide or just slash away at them for
                  your own amusement. They barely seem to notice.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZAP_BUG</h2>They usually drift about peacefully, but sometimes they
                  cluster together and spit out a sharp, crackling flash that will stun and
                  burn even large beasts like myself. Watch closely for an opening and move
                  past them quickly.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_BARGER</h2>A thick orange mist fills these walking corpses. It
                  has a sweet, sickly taste to it. I find it foul. After you kill these
                  creatures, I suggest you do not eat them.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_BEAM_MINER</h2>There is some strange power hidden in the crystals
                  that grow up there in the peaks. They gleam and glow in the darkness, a
                  bright point of searing heat in each one. They sing too, if you listen. Very
                  softly...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_BURSTING</h2>The bugs of Hallownest were twisted out of shape by
                  that ancient sickness. First they fell into deep slumber, then they awoke
                  with broken minds, and then their bodies started to deform...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_GUARD</h2>Larger and stronger than their brothers, these bugs are
                  still forced to steal their weapons from the remains of other creatures.
                  They do not roam or hunt, forever standing guard and lashing out at anything
                  that wanders near.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_HIVE</h2>Did the hivelings build their nest around this sorry
                  bug, or did the bug squeeze its body into their nest? Either way, they seem
                  happy enough together.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_HORNHEAD</h2>These bugs have an arrogant air about them, even
                  after dying. Overly proud of their long horns! I enjoy snapping them
                  off.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_LEAPER</h2>The bugs of old Hallownest did not hunt their own
                  food, they had it brought to them. That's why they were so weak. That's why
                  their kingdom crumbled into dust and faded away!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_MINER</h2>The bugs of Hallownest lusted after the strangest
                  things in life. They would dig furtively through the dirt for stone, ore and
                  in particular the crystals that grow at the top of the world.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_ROYAL_1</h2>It seems the weakest, greediest members of Hallownest
                  were also the ones who exerted the most influence. Truly a Kingdom that was
                  always destined for ruin.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_ROYAL_2</h2>The fearful, cowardly nature of these Hallownest bugs
                  persists even after death! It almost feels shameful to chase and cut them
                  down.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_ROYAL_FAT</h2>As these bugs became wealthier they hunted less and
                  consumed more, eventually taking on a grotesque shape not unlike over-ripe
                  fruit.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_RUNNER</h2>These "civilised" bugs of Hallownest were weak in life
                  and now they are equally weak in death. Send them back into the dirt they
                  were born in!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_SHIELD</h2>Softened by generations of luxury, these bugs lack
                  claws or armour or venom. Those who wish to protect themselves are forced to
                  fashion weapons from stone, ore or shell.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_SPIDER</h2>The beasts of this land have found plenty of ingenious
                  hiding places, but none so clever as the body of another creature! If you
                  happen on such a beast, rejoice! You've hunted two creatures at
                  once!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_SPINE</h2>The spines they fire seem to be mildly poisonous. Don't
                  use them to clean between your fangs after eating!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOM_SPITTING</h2>The infection that swept through Hallownest so long
                  ago... they say that the harder you struggled against it, the more it
                  consumed you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOTE</h2>Some rare creatures are so weak, so helpless, so inept and
                  so irritating that hunting them gives no pleasure.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOTE_BALLOON</h2>The Grey Prince was a wanderer by nature, but she
                  could not bear to be separated from him. So she devised a plan to make sure
                  that she and her prince would be together always. She only had to wait for
                  her chance. - 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 205</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOTE_FLYER</h2>She asked whether he had bought the Charm for her as
                  he promised he would, but then he explained. The Charm was actually of low
                  quality and not worth the price asked. She understood the wisdom of his
                  decision perfectly. - 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 136</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOTE_ZOTE_HOPPER</h2>"That lowly map-maker's wife? Hah! My Queen, how
                  could you compare yourself to her? In the face of your intoxicating beauty,
                  all other females are merely dust!" The Grey Prince trembled with anger and
                  indignation... and love. - 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 178</li>
