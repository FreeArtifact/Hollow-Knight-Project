                  <p> The Maiden's Quest Her Grey Prince diminished and
                     her White Saviour revealed as beast, the Maiden at last understood the
                     truth. Her life's companion would not appear, for they could not appear to a
                     maiden sat idle. She must instead seek them out, must find her love, and
                     free them of their solitude. And thus her own journey began, out into
                     dangerous lands, shielded by her love awaiting, guided by her love to be.
                     With every step, the maiden could feel it, their fated meeting, coming ever
                     closer. </p>

                  <p>Mrmm. You came. The red flame I've gathered from this
                     dead Kingdom. You would claim it... for our Master. For his final act. The
                     Ritual plays itself out once more. We are like the notes in an old, old
                     song. You and me. Mrmm.</p>

                     For the Ritual. For the troupe. For the Master. Even this child was born
                     into invisible chains. Mrmm.</p>

                     song at all. You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no
                     Master. Is it so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let
                     this dead Kingdom rest in peace. If you wish to silence the endless song...
                     Mrmm, meet me where it began. But if you return to the Master and complete
                     the Ritual... Mrmm. As long as you do it without regret, I will bear you no

                     return to the Master... Thus it goes, as it ever has. We are like the notes
                     in an old, old song. You and me. Mrmm. And yet... It is not merely by
                     fortune that we meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world,
                     where my Master's scarlet eyes can not see us. Mrmm. A song that never

                     would join me in breaking it then? It is painful to defy the Master, but our
                     harvest... it profanes this dark, quiet Kingdom. This once, I would see the
                     Ritual fail. Mrmm.. Now! Let us destroy the anchor, and banish the Master.
