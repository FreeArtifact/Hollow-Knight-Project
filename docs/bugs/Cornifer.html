                  <p>It's a long trek back to the shop from here. I'll be
                     resting my legs a little longer. Not too long though! It won't do to have
                     Iselda worrying after me.</p>

                  <p>Old caverns these ones. Can't you just feel the weight of
                     the kingdom above? It's a heavy thing alright. I reckon not many'd reach
                     these depths. We're pioneers you and I, at least in recent history.</p>

                  <h2>CITY_BOUGHT:</h2>
                  <p>We've both come far to reach this grand place. While I'm
                     about these buildings, I must remember to collect a trinket or two for
                     Iselda. </p>

                  <h2>CITY_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Isn't this a change from those twisting natural caverns?
                     The rain does cast something of a sadness upon it all but the architecture
                     is simply splendid. Charting such a different space is quite the challenge,
                     though one I've eagerly undertaken. Perhaps you'd care to purchase a copy of
                     my achievements so far? </p>

                  <h2>CLIFFS_BOUGHT:</h2>
                  <p>I chanced upon a strange bug atop these cliffs. His
                     house isn't far from here. A very imposing figure he was and no doubt lethal
                     with a Nail. I suspect you two might share more in common than him and
                     I.</p>

                  <h2>CLIFFS_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Enjoying the bracing air? We're quite close to
                     Hallownest's borders and those desolate plains that surround it. In this
                     direction, I'm about as far as I'm willing to go, though it's been a
                     pleasant change from the tight confines of the caverns. I've drawn out a
                     small map for the area. It's a simple one and more for completion really.
                     Not knowing the full extents of a region can be quite frustrating.</p>

                  <p>How are you finding my map? I've tried to fill out
                     as much as I can, but every map is a work in progress. If you'd like to fill
                     out some of the map yourself you can purchase some mapping supplies from my
                     wife up in Dirtmouth. We've set up a little store to help make ends
                     meet.</p>

               <li>
                  <h2>CROSSROADS_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Hello again! Still winding your way through these
                     beautiful highways? Just imagine how they must have looked during the
                     kingdom's height, thick with traffic and bustling with life! I wish I could
                     have seen it. Oh, and I suppose I should ask... are you interested in buying
                     a copy of my map for this area...?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DEEPNEST_BOUGHT:</h2>
                  <p>W-w-what a horrid warren of angry beasts. It's going
                     to take a whole lot of effort to climb out of this dark pit. I think I-I'll
                     hide here a little longer. </p>

                  <h2>DEEPNEST_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>This p-place gives me the creeps. Vicious little
                     creatures burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark,
                     twisting maze. Unless you're well prepared, I'd urge you to leave, though if
                     you're feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy my
                     map?</p>

                  <h2>FOG_CANYON_BOUGHT:</h2>
                  <p>There's a large building just below here, out in the
                     middle of a lake and a marvel to observe. I tried to head in, but it's
                     become a nest for those slimey, see-through creatures. Ugh. They're just
                     so... gross, and they give a nasty shock to touch. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FOG_CANYON_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Ho ho! As odd as much of Hallownest can be, there's a
                     whole new level of strangeness about these caves. Did you see that dark gate
                     below? It's quite unsettling to be near. I did my best to avoid it.
                     Fortunate for me, I found another route in, though I did end up a little
                     singed after wading through some acid.</p>

               <li>
                  <h2>FUNGAL_WASTES_BOUGHT:</h2>
                  <p>There's a potent odour about these caverns and
                     far worse for me I suspect. My trunk is quite sensitive whereas you don't
                     seem to possess a scent organ of any kind. Is it that you cannot smell at
                     all?</p>

                  <h2>FUNGAL_WASTES_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Ahh my short friend, you've caught me at the
                     perfect time. I'm just about finished charting these noxious caverns. Very
                     territorial types make their homes within this area. I'd suggest avoiding
                     them where possible. Further below some strange thin creatures gave me quite
                     a scare. They seemed an intelligent bunch. In my youth I'd have braved their
                     caves but I fear my matured physique wouldn't be able to outrun them were
                     they to turn violent.</p>

                  <h2>GREENPATH_BOUGHT:</h2>
                  <p>I ran into another traveller as I made my way down
                     here. I tried to call out to her as she dashed past but she barely even
                     glanced in my direction. Not an appreciater of maps like you and I,
                     obviously.</p>

                  <h2>GREENPATH_GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Isn't this a contrast from the Crossroads? Such a
                     humid, lively place. The roads twist and turn in the most wonderful ways.
                     I've done my best to chart the area ahead, though I must admit some of the
                     area's inhabitants proved quite a nuisance.</p>

                     I should apologise for that. When you spend a lot of time by yourself, with
                     just your own thoughts, you forget the niceties of conversation.</p>

                     world. Why, when I was first hatched I wandered off immediately, leaving my
                     brothers and sisters and poor mother behind! That's why as soon as I could I
                     moved to Dirtmouth with my wife. A huge, unending Kingdom to explore right
                     on our doorstep. Who could resist? Anyway, I'll let you return to your
                     travels. With a little luck, we'll meet again. Be safe and farewell!</p>

                  <p>A map can be a useful thing, but it alone won't show you
                     where you are. If you've not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a
                     compass from my wife, Iselda. She's just now opening our new map shop in
                     Dirtmouth, selling all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself.
                     She'll even sell some of my old maps from time to time. I pop back to see
                     her whenever I finish mapping an area. She's always so excited to see
                     me.</p>

                     tried to chart the dense nest beneath here b-b-but it's proving too
                     dangerous for a bug like me. Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over
