                  <p>Aren't my nails the most wonderful things? Their
                     gleaming blades so sharp and deadly. </p>

                  <p>Do you like my nails little wanderer? I carry only three,
                     far less than legends may suggest. Still! Each is sharper than the last and
                     I'd require only one to cut you down. </p>

                  <p>Don't fear little creature. Though a violent rage once

                  <p>You too are a warrior? I see your nail, but your shell
                     seems underdeveloped. In your current state, to travel a land as dangerous
                     as this seems unwise.</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>BOSS_TALK:</h2>
                  <p>I came from far away to reach this place. Though my shell

                  <p>Do you think dark thoughts little one? When hidden
                     behind a visage as impassive as your own, I find it hard to tell.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CASPIAN_TALK:</h2>
                  <p>Beware your own mind little one. Twisted minds breed dark
                     deeds and mine was more twisted than most. I thought it would be my end, but
                     instead I found this glade and with it a sort of peace.</p>

                  <h2>CHAGAX_TALK:</h2>
                  <p>I used to help others. They were brought to me sick and
                     dying... What difference did it make?... Any victory against death will
                     always be temporary.</p>

                  <h2>FALSE_KNIGHT:</h2>
                  <p>I wanted it.... the strength to protect the others...
                     When I saw that Knight... sleeping... safe in his big armoured shell... It
                     wasn't madness that drove me to it... I just wanted it... But... in the end?
                     If strength cannot save you, then what can...?</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>GALIEN_DEFEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Unbelievable... I am defeated at last! So this is what
                     it feels like to be bested... Still though, I am strong, am I not? When you
                     see our King, surely you'll tell him of my valour...? Yes... he sent you
                     here to test me, didn't he? I knew he had not forgotten brave Galien. I am
                     ready... to join you now. Brothers, you and I. Let us leave this place...
                     ...together...</p>

                  <h2>GALIEN_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength
                     in joyful combat!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GALIEN_TALK:</h2>
                  <p>Hoh, a fellow warrior, out here? I thought I was the only
                     one brave enough and strong enough to survive in this foul, forgotten pit. I
                     am Galien, the strongest warrior in Hallownest! I came to this monstrous
                     place to test my strength. No doubt you wish to test your might as well,
                     hmm? Yes, you and I are a rare breed, quite unlike this poor fellow who has
                     fallen before us. The world is not kind to the weak, I fear. So then...
                     shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!</p>

                  <h2>GARRO_TALK:</h2>
                  <p>Are you a warrior, little one? A true warrior is one who
                     can stand strong in the midst of a storm.</p>

                  <p>Left or right? Which way is best? It should be a
                     simple thing, yet we're always at odds. </p>

               <li>
                  <h2>GRASSHOPPER_TALK:</h2>
                  <p>Isn't this just the most intriguing place? So many
                     discoveries waiting to be made. We're about to set off ourselves, though we
                     can't seem to agree on which way to head. It's led to something of an
                     argument between us. We should really stop squabbling about such petty
                     things. </p>

                  <p>Do as you will little wanderer. Cut a path toward
                     your goal. I shouldn't complain. It's your kind that keeps folks like me in
                     business.</p>

               <li>
                  <h2>GRAVEDIGGER_TALK:</h2>
                  <p>Ehh... Another wielding a weapon. I suppose you'll be
                     leaving many a corpse in your wake? If you won't spare thought for the dead
                     at least consider all the extra work you force upon those in my profession. </p>

                  <p>These husks around my neck? They're my precious friends,
                     always there to keep me company and much better for conversation than the
                     rest of the odd lot around here.</p>

                     Let your mistakes not burden you, but serve as guideposts on where not to

                     resolve your past then know I am not the queen you seek. It is the pale
                     beings that bear blame for your nature. Though this hive exists within
                     Hallownest, we play no part in its attempt at perpetuation.</p>

                     Aah... I remember. Those proud lords... were they truly monsters? I remember
                     their eyes now... bright and clear. Why then did I fear them so? If there
                     was madness in that village, it was I who brought it. They were right to
                     cast me out. When I attacked, they were right to... They were right to
                     kill... To kill... me...? ...aah.</p>

                     this savage, ruined land? Many have come to purify this place, but all who
                     dwell here are eventually consumed. Yes, even the wild bugs lurking below
                     us. They were once proud like you, but now they are only monsters. Beware
                     dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.</p>

                     But the King... why?! He opposed everything I did... His jealousy... his
                     madness... by standing against me he robbed me of my immortality! Now the

                     may find it hard to believe. Huge crowds once flocked to hear me sing, then
                     something changed. The audience, once so enrapt, began to leave. I continued
                     to sing yet my voice fell silent upon their ears. Perhaps you'd care to
                     listen to me sing? You'll be the first in an age to hear it.</p>
