               <li>
                  <h2>100NAIL_REPEAT</h2>Aren't my nails the most wonderful things? Their
                  gleaming blades so sharp and deadly. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>100NAIL_TALK</h2>Do you like my nails little wanderer? I carry only three,
                  far less than legends may suggest. Still! Each is sharper than the last and
                  I'd require only one to cut you down. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ALADAR_DEFEAT</h2>I... am Gorb! The great mind... the pain! Ascend!
                  Ascend! I... I am...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ALADAR_INSPECT</h2>Here lies Gorb, the Great Mind.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ALADAR_REPEAT</h2>Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ALADAR_TALK</h2>I am Gorb! Bow! Bow bow bow bow to Gorb! The great mind! I
                  am Gorb! Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ATRA_REPEAT</h2>My appearance should not cause you worry. Here I am truly
                  at peace.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ATRA_TALK</h2>Don't fear little creature. Though a violent rage once
                  possessed me the peaceful air in this place seems to keep it at bay. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>BOSS_REPEAT</h2>You too are a warrior? I see your nail, but your shell
                  seems underdeveloped. In your current state, to travel a land as dangerous
                  as this seems unwise.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>BOSS_TALK</h2>I came from far away to reach this place. Though my shell
                  may seem foreign, beneath it I am a bug the same as you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CASPIAN_REPEAT</h2>Do you think dark thoughts little one? When hidden
                  behind a visage as impassive as your own, I find it hard to tell.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CASPIAN_TALK</h2>Beware your own mind little one. Twisted minds breed dark
                  deeds and mine was more twisted than most. I thought it would be my end, but
                  instead I found this glade and with it a sort of peace.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CHAGAX_REPEAT</h2>Any victory against death will always be temporary....
                  What a gloomy thought.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CHAGAX_TALK</h2>I used to help others. They were brought to me sick and
                  dying... What difference did it make?... Any victory against death will
                  always be temporary.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FALSE_KNIGHT</h2>I wanted it.... the strength to protect the others...
                  When I saw that Knight... sleeping... safe in his big armoured shell... It
                  wasn't madness that drove me to it... I just wanted it... But... in the end?
                  If strength cannot save you, then what can...?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GALIEN_DEFEAT</h2>Unbelievable... I am defeated at last! So this is what
                  it feels like to be bested... Still though, I am strong, am I not? When you
                  see our King, surely you'll tell him of my valour...? Yes... he sent you
                  here to test me, didn't he? I knew he had not forgotten brave Galien. I am
                  ready... to join you now. Brothers, you and I. Let us leave this place...
                  ...together...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GALIEN_INSPECT</h2>The body of a fallen warrior.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GALIEN_REPEAT</h2>So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength
                  in joyful combat!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GALIEN_TALK</h2>Hoh, a fellow warrior, out here? I thought I was the only
                  one brave enough and strong enough to survive in this foul, forgotten pit. I
                  am Galien, the strongest warrior in Hallownest! I came to this monstrous
                  place to test my strength. No doubt you wish to test your might as well,
                  hmm? Yes, you and I are a rare breed, quite unlike this poor fellow who has
                  fallen before us. The world is not kind to the weak, I fear. So then...
                  shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GARRO_REPEAT</h2>Stand strong little warrior.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GARRO_TALK</h2>Are you a warrior, little one? A true warrior is one who
                  can stand strong in the midst of a storm.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GRASSHOPPER_REPEAT</h2>Left or right? Which way is best? It should be a
                  simple thing, yet we're always at odds. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GRASSHOPPER_TALK</h2>Isn't this just the most intriguing place? So many
                  discoveries waiting to be made. We're about to set off ourselves, though we
                  can't seem to agree on which way to head. It's led to something of an
                  argument between us. We should really stop squabbling about such petty
                  things. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GRAVEDIGGER_REPEAT</h2>Do as you will little wanderer. Cut a path toward
                  your goal. I shouldn't complain. It's your kind that keeps folks like me in
                  business.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GRAVEDIGGER_TALK</h2>Ehh... Another wielding a weapon. I suppose you'll be
                  leaving many a corpse in your wake? If you won't spare thought for the dead
                  at least consider all the extra work you force upon those in my profession. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GROHAC_REPEAT</h2>These husks around my neck? They're my precious friends,
                  always there to keep me company and much better for conversation than the
                  rest of the odd lot around here.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GROHAC_TALK</h2>We're always left with reminders of the errors we've made.
                  Let your mistakes not burden you, but serve as guideposts on where not to
                  travel.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HEX_REPEAT</h2>Go bother someone else. You're not the one I'm waiting
                  for.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HEX_TALK</h2>"I'll see you soon," she said, though that was long ago. I
                  wonder where she went?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HIVEQUEEN_EXTRA</h2>My Knight... At last you are freed.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HIVEQUEEN_REPEAT</h2>To rail against nature is folly. All things must
                  accept an end. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HIVEQUEEN_TALK</h2>Small thing. I know your kind. If you attempt to
                  resolve your past then know I am not the queen you seek. It is the pale
                  beings that bear blame for your nature. Though this hive exists within
                  Hallownest, we play no part in its attempt at perpetuation.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HU_DEFEAT</h2>My mind... it clears. Have we been... sleeping, child?
                  Aah... I remember. Those proud lords... were they truly monsters? I remember
                  their eyes now... bright and clear. Why then did I fear them so? If there
                  was madness in that village, it was I who brought it. They were right to
                  cast me out. When I attacked, they were right to... They were right to
                  kill... To kill... me...? ...aah.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HU_INSPECT</h2>We remember the Elder.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HU_REPEAT</h2>Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not
                  return.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HU_TALK</h2>Wait, child! Why have you come here? Have you come to tame
                  this savage, ruined land? Many have come to purify this place, but all who
                  dwell here are eventually consumed. Yes, even the wild bugs lurking below
                  us. They were once proud like you, but now they are only monsters. Beware
                  dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>JONI_REPEAT</h2>Isn't it just so peaceful here? Such a perfect place to
                  rest.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>JONI_TALK</h2>Ahhh, I see you bear my blessing. I can't remember giving
                  it, but my memory has been a little lacking of late.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KARINA_REPEAT</h2>You don't seem to bear the markings of rank, though you
                  bear no markings of a lower form. What are you? Do tell me. Are you a higher
                  being or just another lowly grub? </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KARINA_TALK</h2>Are you admiring my fabulous markings? I'm of a
                  distinguished species you see, though I've not seen another like me for the
                  longest time.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KCIN_REPEAT</h2>Seeking power is a hollow goal. Best to search for other
                  things.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KCIN_TALK</h2>I was once obsessed with power though my time within this
                  glade has shed me of such desire. What folly it was to ever crave such a
                  vicious thing. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MAGE_LORD</h2>In my dreams I could see it. The Kingdom's salvation, the
                  cure for the plague... the answer was in the soul that animates our bodies.
                  But the King... why?! He opposed everything I did... His jealousy... his
                  madness... by standing against me he robbed me of my immortality! Now the
                  King and his Kingdom are dead... but I... will live forever.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MAGNUS_REPEAT</h2>Remember tiny bug, crush your fears; crush your
                  problems; crush your foes.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MAGNUS_TALK</h2>All of life's problems can be solved with crushing force.
                  Such a simple mantra and one I've always lived by. If you weren't so
                  scrawny, I'd suggest you follow my example.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MARISSA_REPEAT</h2>Even if only you, it's a wonderful thing to have an
                  audience again.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MARISSA_TALK</h2>Welcome to my stage little one. I am Marissa, a
                  songstress of some renown, though given the sorry state of this place, you
                  may find it hard to believe. Huge crowds once flocked to hear me sing, then
                  something changed. The audience, once so enrapt, began to leave. I continued
                  to sing yet my voice fell silent upon their ears. Perhaps you'd care to
                  listen to me sing? You'll be the first in an age to hear it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MARKOTH_DEFEAT</h2>Never... have I been defeated in combat. I can... see
                  myself there, still sleeping. How long have I been hidden here? Here at the
                  edge of the world, no-one could find me... except you. Warriors, knights,
                  kings, even time itself... they have no power over me. Only you. You are the
                  darkness... come to consume me.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MARKOTH_INSPECT</h2>The body of a warrior, with a shield and
                  nails.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MARKOTH_REPEAT</h2>Raise your weapon then, fool, and die like those who
                  came before you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MARKOTH_TALK</h2>You have come a long way, just to die here at the edge of
                  the world. No, do not speak. I have heard thousands and thousands of empty
                  words from those like you. Your pride, your desires, your desperation... you
                  will take these things with you once I strike you down. Raise your weapon
                  then, and die like those who came before you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MILLY_REPEAT</h2>Buy my cookies! Once I've sold them all I can go
                  home.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MILLY_TALK</h2>Buy my cookies! They're ever so tasty.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MOLTEN_REPEAT</h2>Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the
                  same.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MOLTEN_TALK</h2>Don't fear my rotting form. Though my body sheds and
                  changes my core remains the same.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MUMCAT_DEFEAT</h2>Oh, stranger... you're strong. Much stronger than me...
                  I've been waiting a long time, stranger. I've been fighting a long time,
                  stranger. I'm very, very tired! The Queen will be here soon, and I just need
                  to sleep a little. Wake me when the Queen arrives, stranger. Perhaps the
                  Queen will teach us both to fly, stranger! That... would be fun... wouldn't
                  it...?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MUMCAT_INSPECT</h2>Protector of root and leaf, we honour you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MUMCAT_REPEAT</h2>Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play
                  together?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MUMCAT_TALK</h2>Oh! The Queen! The Queen is coming! I've been waiting so
                  long, and now she's almost here! I feel like I'm about to burst! I've kept
                  it safe, this sacred garden! I've kept it safe for all this time, and soon
                  the Queen will return and teach me to fly! Shall we wait together, stranger?
                  Shall we play together?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOEYES_DEFEAT</h2>One by one... their eyes closed at last. I felt it... a
                  warm stillness falling over us. I'm sorry I was frightened of you. You were
                  always protecting us, even when we couldn't see you. Take us there, please.
                  A place where light can not haunt us, a place without
                  dreams...Please...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOEYES_INSPECT</h2>A face carved from stone.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOEYES_REPEAT</h2>Precious children, a monster has come for us in the
                  dark...Will you sing for me?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOEYES_TALK</h2>My child... can you still see? Please, don't hurt me.
                  Can't sleep... with your eyes open, little one. Can't dream... if you're
                  still breathing, little one. Precious children... you speak such loathsome
                  things as you sleep... your claws scratch and scrape... Precious children, a
                  monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PERPETOS_REPEAT</h2>You're very impressive for such a small thing. I'm
                  something of a warrior myself, though even I'd hesitate to raise my nail
                  against you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PERPETOS_TALK</h2>Are you enjoying your time in our glade? I'd offer
                  advice, though to have made it here you're obviously quite adept at
                  navigating our world and its perils.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>POGGY_REPEAT</h2>I've been waiting an awfully long while. Surely it's
                  dinner time soon?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>POGGY_TALK</h2>Skroink! You look pretty skinny. Very scrawny. That's the
                  way to be I reckon. Just look at me! A great big, juicy, fatty, oily...
                  scrumptious bug. No wonder I'm so popular around here.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REVEK_REPEAT</h2>I assure you wanderer, my nail is sharp and I'll not hold
                  back.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REVEK_TALK</h2>The bugs within this glade are under my watch. Treat them
                  with respect and you may remain, but raise your nail and you'll contend with
                  me.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REVEK_TALK_DEFEAT</h2>The glade has stilled. It's so quiet, yet I feel...
                  failure? In this place, I once performed a task, but what was it?.. It's so
                  hard to recall. Surely it was important? How could I forget such a
                  thing?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REVEK_TALK_DEFEAT_REPEAT</h2>To protect? Was that my task? If so, who was
                  I protecting? It's only you and me here. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>THISTLEWIND_REPEAT</h2>You find it strange to see a moth wielding a
                  weapon? We are a passive species, though I am not the only one amongst us to
                  take up arms. Another braved the edges of this world, hoping to uncover a
                  truth long forgotten. I wonder what became of him?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>THISTLEWIND_TALK</h2>Ahhh, a wanderer. I've been many places and done a
                  great many things, but I suspect you will outdo me by far. I've long ceased
                  travelling the caverns of Hallownest and I suspect they're now far more
                  dangerous than in my journeys, though with your capable air I'm sure you'll
                  do fine. Good luck! It's a vast world out there.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WALDIE_REPEAT</h2>You wouldn't have the guts to face me anyway.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WALDIE_TALK</h2>Don't judge me by appearance. Though my stature is small,
                  I bear a dark soul and a tendency to go berserk in battle.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WAYNER_REPEAT</h2>I'm envious of you, facing this world without fear. I
                  could stand to learn from your approach.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WAYNER_TALK</h2>Hark, fellow adventurer! Are you heading out into the
                  world? I'd join you, but it's been so long, I fear I'd lose my head.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WYATT_REPEAT</h2>Don't get too close. I'd not wish to cause any
                  harm.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WYATT_TALK</h2>Watch out! I've an acidic touch and I wouldn't want you
                  getting burned. It's a protection system of my kind, though something of a
                  nuisance when it comes to meeting others.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>XERO_DEFEAT</h2>Ah... I can see now. Those who turn against the King are
                  doomed as soon as they raise their weapon. Do not call me a traitor. Simply
                  call me a fool. I know you will not flee. Wherever you go... I will be
                  watching.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>XERO_INSPECT</h2>Cursed are those who turn against the King.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>XERO_REPEAT</h2>Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you
                  raise your weapon and doom us both?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>XERO_TALK</h2>Stop there! Those who try to leave this kingdom are cursed.
                  Better to rest here, until time itself sleeps. Hope and freedom. I thought
                  that strength alone could grant me these things. In my dreams I would cut
                  that plague with my nails, and then I turned my weapons upon the King. When
                  I awoke in this sacred place, I began to understand. Those who hope are
                  already doomed. Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you
                  raise your weapon and doom us both?</li>
