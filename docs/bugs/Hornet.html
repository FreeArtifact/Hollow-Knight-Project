            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>ABYSS_ASCENT_01</h2>Ghost. I see you've faced the place of your
                  birth, and now drape yourself in the substance of its shadow. Though our
                  strength is born of similar source, that part of you, that crucial
                  emptiness, I do not share. Funny then, that such darkness gives me hope.
                  Within it, I see the chance of change. A difficult journey you would face,
                  but a choice it can create. Prolong our world's stasis or face the heart of
                  its infection. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ABYSS_DREAM</h2>...It faced the void, and ascends unscathed... Could
                  it unite such vast darkness?..</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ABYSS_REPEAT</h2>I'd urge you to take that harder path, but what end
                  may come, the decision rests with you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DOOR_UNOPENED</h2>I'm impressed little ghost. You've burdened
                  yourself with the fate of this world, yet you still stand strong. To break
                  the Dreamer's seals would alone be considered an impossible task, but to
                  accept that void inside yourself, that casts you as something rather
                  exceptional.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FINAL_BOSS</h2>Do it! Make your choice. My thread will only hold so
                  long. Prolong our world's stasis or face the heart of its infection.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FOUNTAIN_1</h2>Again we meet little ghost. I'm normally quite
                  perceptive. You I underestimated, though I've since guessed the truth.
                  You've seen beyond this kingdom's bounds. Yours is resilience born of two
                  voids. It's no surprise then you've managed to reach the heart of this
                  world. In so doing, you shall know the sacrifice that keeps it
                  standing.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FOUNTAIN_2</h2>If, knowing that truth, you'd still attempt a role in
                  Hallownest's perpetuation, seek the Grave in Ash and the mark it would grant
                  to one like you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREENPATH</h2>Come no closer, ghost. I've seen you, creeping through
                  the undergrowth, stalking me. This old kingdom... A terrible thing awakens.
                  I can smell it in the air... I know what you are. I know what you'd try to
                  do. I can't allow it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>INSPECT_IK</h2>The remains of a wanderer, long deceased.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS_1</h2>So you'd pursue the deeper truth? It isn't one the
                  weak could bear.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS_2</h2>Prove yourself ready to face it. I'll not hold back.
                  My needle is lethal and I'd feel no sadness in a weakling's demise. Show me
                  you can accept this Kingdom's past and claim responsibility for its future. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS_DEFEAT</h2>...So strong... You could do it, if you had the
                  will. But could you raise your nail once knowing its tragic conception? And
                  knowing yourself?... Then do it, Ghost of Hallownest! Head onward. Burn that
                  mark upon your shell and claim yourself as King.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRE_FINAL_BATTLE</h2>The path is opened. One way or another an end
                  awaits inside. I won't be joining you in this. That space is built to
                  sustain your likes. Its bindings would drain me were I to join. Don't be
                  surprised. I'll not risk my own life in your attempt, though if the moment
                  presents I'll aid as I'm able.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_DREAM</h2>...Could it achieve that impossible thing?
                  Should it?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_REPEAT</h2>Ghost of Hallownest, you possess the
                  strength to enact an end of your choosing. Would you supplant our
                  birth-cursed sibling, or would you transcend it?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPIDER_TOWN_01</h2>So you've slain the Beast... and you head towards
                  that fated goal. I'd not have obstructed this happening, but it caused me
                  some pain to knowingly stand idle. ...What? You might think me stern but I'm
                  not completely cold. We do not choose our mothers, or the circumstance into
                  which we are born. Despite all the ills of this world, I'm thankful for the
                  life she granted me. It's quite a debt I owed. Only in allowing her to pass,
                  and taking the burden of the future in her stead, can I begin to repay
                  it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPIDER_TOWN_DREAM</h2>...Mother... Forgive my inaction... but another
                  path may be possible...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPIDER_TOWN_REPEAT</h2>Leave me now, ghost. Allow me a moment alone
                  before this bedchamber becomes forever a shrine.</li>
