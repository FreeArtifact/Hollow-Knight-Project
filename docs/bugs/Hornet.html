               <li>
                  <h2>ABYSS_ASCENT_01:</h2>
                  <p>Ghost. I see you've faced the place of your
                     birth, and now drape yourself in the substance of its shadow. Though our
                     strength is born of similar source, that part of you, that crucial
                     emptiness, I do not share. Funny then, that such darkness gives me hope.
                     Within it, I see the chance of change. A difficult journey you would face,
                     but a choice it can create. Prolong our world's stasis or face the heart of
                     its infection. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ABYSS_DREAM:</h2>
                  <p>...It faced the void, and ascends unscathed... Could
                     it unite such vast darkness?..</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ABYSS_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>I'd urge you to take that harder path, but what end
                     may come, the decision rests with you.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DOOR_UNOPENED:</h2>
                  <p>I'm impressed little ghost. You've burdened
                     yourself with the fate of this world, yet you still stand strong. To break
                     the Dreamer's seals would alone be considered an impossible task, but to
                     accept that void inside yourself, that casts you as something rather
                     exceptional.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FINAL_BOSS:</h2>
                  <p>Do it! Make your choice. My thread will only hold so
                     long. Prolong our world's stasis or face the heart of its infection.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FOUNTAIN_1:</h2>
                  <p>Again we meet little ghost. I'm normally quite
                     perceptive. You I underestimated, though I've since guessed the truth.
                     You've seen beyond this kingdom's bounds. Yours is resilience born of two
                     voids. It's no surprise then you've managed to reach the heart of this
                     world. In so doing, you shall know the sacrifice that keeps it
                     standing.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FOUNTAIN_2:</h2>
                  <p>If, knowing that truth, you'd still attempt a role in
                     Hallownest's perpetuation, seek the Grave in Ash and the mark it would grant
                     to one like you.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREENPATH:</h2>
                  <p>Come no closer, ghost. I've seen you, creeping through
                     the undergrowth, stalking me. This old kingdom... A terrible thing awakens.
                     I can smell it in the air... I know what you are. I know what you'd try to
                     do. I can't allow it.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>INSPECT_IK:</h2>
                  <p>The remains of a wanderer, long deceased.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS_1:</h2>
                  <p>So you'd pursue the deeper truth? It isn't one the
                     weak could bear.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS_2:</h2>
                  <p>Prove yourself ready to face it. I'll not hold back.
                     My needle is lethal and I'd feel no sadness in a weakling's demise. Show me
                     you can accept this Kingdom's past and claim responsibility for its future. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS_DEFEAT:</h2>
                  <p>...So strong... You could do it, if you had the
                     will. But could you raise your nail once knowing its tragic conception? And
                     knowing yourself?... Then do it, Ghost of Hallownest! Head onward. Burn that
                     mark upon your shell and claim yourself as King.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRE_FINAL_BATTLE:</h2>
                  <p>The path is opened. One way or another an end
                     awaits inside. I won't be joining you in this. That space is built to
                     sustain your likes. Its bindings would drain me were I to join. Don't be
                     surprised. I'll not risk my own life in your attempt, though if the moment
                     presents I'll aid as I'm able.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_DREAM:</h2>
                  <p>...Could it achieve that impossible thing?
                     Should it?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Ghost of Hallownest, you possess the
                     strength to enact an end of your choosing. Would you supplant our
                     birth-cursed sibling, or would you transcend it?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPIDER_TOWN_01:</h2>
                  <p>So you've slain the Beast... and you head towards
                     that fated goal. I'd not have obstructed this happening, but it caused me
                     some pain to knowingly stand idle. ...What? You might think me stern but I'm
                     not completely cold. We do not choose our mothers, or the circumstance into
                     which we are born. Despite all the ills of this world, I'm thankful for the
                     life she granted me. It's quite a debt I owed. Only in allowing her to pass,
                     and taking the burden of the future in her stead, can I begin to repay
                     it.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPIDER_TOWN_DREAM:</h2>
                  <p>...Mother... Forgive my inaction... but another
                     path may be possible...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SPIDER_TOWN_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Leave me now, ghost. Allow me a moment alone
                     before this bedchamber becomes forever a shrine.</p>
