                  <p>Just what do you think you're doing?! You dare to come
                     between me and my prey? Is it a habit of yours to scurry about, getting in
                     the way and causing bother?</p>

                  <h2>BUZZER_1_B:</h2>
                  <p>Know this, cur. I am Zote the Mighty, a knight of
                     great renown. Cross me again, and you'll find out why they call my weapon
                     'Life Ender'.</p>

                  <p>What are you still bothering me for? I'm a Knight. I'm
                     not interested in your childish games. I need my rest. Begone! Lest I draw
                     my nail...</p>

                  <p>I suppose you're impressed by how tall the towers are
                     here. Hmph. I've seen much taller towers in my travels. Much nicer,
                     too.</p>

                  <p>Hoy! Watch where you're going, you soggy vagabond! I
                     don't want you splashing me. I've had a miserable time trying to keep dry. I
                     am Zote the Mighty, a knight of great renown. If I decide that I'm going to
                     stay dry, then that's what's going to happen! Curse this wretched city!
                     Water and monsters constantly fall from above! It's no wonder this blasted
                     kingdom fell to ruin...</p>

                  <p>Have you seen them? The guards who still patrol this
                     city, even after dying? Hmph. Being overly devoted to one's duties is no
                     virtue.</p>

                  <p>I have been fighting my whole life. I've slain
                     hundreds, nay thousands, of foes. And these fools think to face me in
                     combat? Madness! It seems they've been gripped by a powerful desire to be
                     destroyed. Very well then. Zote the Mighty will grant them their
                     desire...</p>

                  <p>Hmm? What do you want, cur? Have you come to laugh
                     at me as well? Fools! Did you never consider that being trapped in this cage
                     was precisely what I intended?! Yes, by all means, release me into your
                     arena! I am Zote the Mighty! And as soon as I draw my nail, 'Life Ender',
                     your laughter will turn into terror!</p>

                  <p>Leave me be, you lowly worm! I must rest before
                     my great battle. Pray we do not meet in the arena...</p>

                  <p>Hoy! What are you doing, you clumsy little oaf?!
                     Swinging your rusty little nail around in the darkness? You almost struck
                     me! And if you had, it would have been the end of you. Trust me! I am Zote
                     the Mighty, a knight of great renown. My weapon, 'Life Ender,' has struck
                     down hundreds of foes. Begone, or you'll be next!</p>

                  <p>Hmm? Are you lost in these dark tunnels? I don't care.
                     No, I won't lead you out. I know the way, due to my powerful memory, but I
                     only travel alone. Begone.</p>

                  <h2>DREAM_BUZZER:</h2>
                  <p>Foolish beast... you dulled your mandibles by
                     gnawing on my indestructible body. No wonder you were defeated by this
                     weakling!</p>

                  <p>How miserable, to be stuck here instead of
                     continuing my quest... I came to this kingdom to fulfill a promise... and
                     that is what I will do...</p>

                  <p>So, the kingdom was hiding this dark nest full of
                     deadly predators. Well, now the deadliest predator of all is here... ...Zote
                     the Mighty!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM_FINAL:</h2>
                  <p>I came to this kingdom to fulfill a promise... and
                     now I have succeeded! That promise I made so long ago... A promise to
                     myself... A promise of glory! Glory for I, Zote the Mighty! I never doubted
                     myself, never faltered, and now I have achieved everything I
                     desired.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM_TOWN1:</h2>
                  <p>This dreary place... it reminds me of home. How
                     ghastly...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_1:</h2>
                  <p>... but that's not the only danger I had to overcome in my
                     quest for glory! You've noticed this trophy, haven't you? A keepsake from my
                     final, triumphant battle deep in the pit below us. Yes, 'Life Ender' claimed
                     another victim, and the crowd erupted into ecstatic cheering. Cheering that
                     was both loud and utterly sincere. To what do I owe my long string of
                     triumphs and victories, you ask? As I said earlier, the key is in my
                     personal philosophy, the 'Fifty-Seven Precepts of Zote'. Particularly
                     relevant here is the first precept: 'Always Win Your Battles'. As for the
                     other fifty-six precepts? Well...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_10:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Ten: 'Keep Your Weapon Sharp'. I make sure that my
                     weapon, 'Life Ender', is kept well-sharpened at all times. This makes it
                     much easier to cut things.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_11:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Eleven: 'Mothers Will Always Betray You'. This
                     precept explains itself.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_12:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twelve: 'Keep Your Cloak Dry'. If your cloak gets
                     wet, dry it as soon as you can. Wearing wet cloaks is unpleasant, and can
                     lead to illness.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_13:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Thirteen: 'Never Be Afraid'. Fear can only hold you
                     back. Facing your fears can be a tremendous effort. Therefore, you should
                     just not be afraid in the first place.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_14:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Fourteen: 'Respect Your Superiors'. If someone is
                     your superior in strength or intellect or both, you need to show them your
                     respect. Don't ignore them or laugh at them.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_15:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Fifteen: 'One Foe, One Blow'. You should only use a
                     single blow to defeat an enemy. Any more is a waste. Also, by counting your
                     blows as you fight, you'll know how many foes you've defeated.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_16:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Sixteen: 'Don't Hesitate'. Once you've made a
                     decision, carry it out and don't look back. You'll achieve much more this
                     way.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_17:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Seventeen: 'Believe In Your Strength'. Others may
                     doubt you, but there's someone you can always trust. Yourself. Make sure to
                     believe in your own strength, and you will never falter.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_18:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Eighteen: 'Seek Truth in the Darkness'. This
                     precept also explains itself.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_19:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Nineteen: 'If You Try, Succeed'. If you're going to
                     attempt something, make sure you achieve it. If you do not succeed, then you
                     have actually failed! Avoid this at all costs.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_1_R:</h2>
                  <p>Precept One: 'Always Win Your Battles'. Losing a battle
                     earns you nothing and teaches you nothing. Win your battles, or don't engage
                     in them at all!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_2:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Two: 'Never Let Them Laugh at You'. Fools laugh at
                     everything, even at their superiors. But beware, laughter isn't harmless!
                     Laughter spreads like a disease, and soon everyone is laughing at you. You
                     need to strike at the source of this perverse merriment quickly to stop it
                     from spreading.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_20:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty: 'Speak Only the Truth'. When speaking to
                     someone, it is courteous and also efficient to speak truthfully. Beware
                     though that speaking truthfully may make you enemies. This is something
                     you'll have to bear.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_21:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-One: 'Be Aware of Your Surroundings'. Don't
                     just walk along staring at the ground! You need to look up every so often,
                     to make sure nothing takes you by surprise.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_22:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Two: 'Abandon the Nest'. As soon as I could,
                     I left my birthplace and made my way out into the world. Do not linger in
                     the nest. There is nothing for you there.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_23:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Three: 'Identify the Foe's Weak Point'.
                     Every foe you encounter has a weak point, such as a crack in their shell or
                     being asleep. You must constantly be alert and scrutinising your enemy to
                     detect their weakness!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_24:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Four: 'Strike the Foe's Weak Point'. Once
                     you have identified your foe's weak point as per the previous precept,
                     strike it. This will instantly destroy them.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_25:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Five: 'Protect Your Own Weak Point'. Be
                     aware that your foe will try to identify your weak point, so you must
                     protect it. The best protection? Never having a weak point in the first
                     place.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_26:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Six: 'Don't Trust Your Reflection'. When
                     peering at certain shining surfaces, you may see a copy of your own face.
                     The face will mimic your movements and seems similar to your own, but I
                     don't think it can be trusted.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_27:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Seven: 'Eat As Much As You Can'. When having
                     a meal, eat as much as you possibly can. This gives you extra energy, and
                     means you can eat less frequently.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_28:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Eight: 'Don't Peer Into the Darkness'. If
                     you peer into the darkness and can't see anything for too long, your mind
                     will start to linger over old memories. Memories are to be avoided, as per
                     Precept Four.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_29:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Twenty-Nine: 'Develop Your Sense of Direction'.
                     It's easy to get lost when travelling through winding, twisting caverns.
                     Having a good sense of direction is like having a magical map inside of your
                     head. Very useful.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>PRECEPT_3:</h2>
                  <p>Precept Three: 'Always Be Rested'. Fighting and adventuring

                     spend too long in the air, the force will crush you against the ground and

                     must go in as fast as possible, but fluids at a slower rate.</p>

                     It is better to spend it when you can, so you can enjoy various things in

                     should be obvious, but I've had others try to argue that one thing, which is
                     clearly what it is and not something else, is actually some other thing,
                     which it isn't. Stay on your guard!</p>

                     When young, you tend to think that the world is vast, huge, gigantic. It's
                     only natural. Unfortunately, it's actually quite a lot smaller than that. I
                     can say this, now having travelled everywhere in the land.</p>

                     exactly what is needed in your weapon. I myself fashioned 'Life Ender' from

                     of hot spirit that dances about recklessly. It can warm you and provide
                     light, but it will also singe your shell if it gets too close.</p>

                     Every creature keeps their desires locked up inside of themselves. If you
                     catch a glimpse of another's desires, resist the urge to claim them as your

                     your food, your land, your body, and even your thoughts! They have done
                     nothing to earn these things. Never bow to them, and make sure to disobey

                     if you resist those ideas, sickness will wrack your body! Best not to dream

                     mourning. Or celebrating for that matter.</p>
