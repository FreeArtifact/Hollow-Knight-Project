                  <h2>ABYSS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. Only faintly
                     though... a black stain deep below the world, surrounded by darkness. Almost
                     a part of it...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CITY:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain in
                     the heart of the kingdom's capital. Rain can not wash it away.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CLIFFS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     high above us, surrounded by howling winds.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>COLOSSEUM:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     surrounded by warriors and fools.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CROSSROADS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     just below us, lost amongst the kingdom's twisting roads and
                     highways.</p>
               </li>
               <li>

                  <p>Oh? Well, if you have no desire to reconcile with your
                     regrets, I can not help you.</p>

                  <h2>DEEPNEST:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain,
                     barely visible in the tunnels of a nest deep below this kingdom.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM:</h2>
                  <p>How long I must have slept. This land is so much darker now, so
                     thick with the stains of regret. Even the air is murkier. If I sleep again,
                     will the darkness creep in here and swallow me whole?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FOG_CANYON:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     lost in the fog of a strange land.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREEN_PATH:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     in a lush, green land.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, hello again. How have you been faring? Have you come to me
                     because of your regrets? Let me peer into you...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HIVE:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     surrounded by golden light, in a hive far away from here.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KINGS_PASS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     nearby, right at the entrance to this kingdom.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>LOST_SHADE:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A black
                     stain hidden away in the darkness below us.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET1:</h2>
                  <p>Welcome, small intruder. I've been sound asleep in here for some
                     time...Some, time? Ah. Yes. Yes. Well now you've gone and woken me up. It's
                     no matter, I suppose. I might even be able to help you.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET2:</h2>
                  <p>I am Jiji, and if you have found your way into my chamber you
                     must need my help. You see, sometimes we leave our regrets behind in the
                     world, like black stains. If we don't deal with these regrets, hope starts
                     to drain from us. Do you have regrets of your own, little one? Let me peer
                     into you for a moment...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MINES:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     almost hidden by the glow of shimmering crystals around it.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOSHADE:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, you don't appear to have any lingering regrets. How lucky
                     for you. You don't need the services of one such as I.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOSHADE_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>You seem to be free of regret. You don't need the
                     services of one such as I. Farewell.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NO_EGGS:</h2>
                  <p>Hmm, but you don't have any food on you. At least nothing that
                     interests me. I can't perform on an empty stomach, so please return once
                     you've found something truly tasty... something nourishing.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NO_EGGS_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>The food I like... it's soft and round and bursts
                     delightfully in your mouth. The smell it emits... just thinking about is
                     getting me excited. It truly is the most sumptuous thing in the world. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     far way at the very edge of the world.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEENS_STATION:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                     stain sitting alone in the Queen's Station.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RESTING_GROUNDS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                     stain in a holy place of repose.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RITUAL_BEGIN:</h2>
                  <p>Mmmm... I will enjoy this morsel tremendously. Now, as
                     promised, we will begin the ritual.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RITUAL_COMPLETED:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, you seem to have made peace with your regrets in
                     a most novel, and dare I say brutal, fashion. What a joy to behold. Farewell
                     for now. I will think of you as I savour my meal.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RITUAL_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Farewell. I will think of you as I savour my
                     meal.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ROYAL_GARDENS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                     stain, marring a garden's beauty.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHADE_CHARM:</h2>
                  <p>Ooohhhh. My masters would be impressed... Rare it is for
                     one to come to terms with their regrets so completely, yet you seem to have
                     managed it. What darkness must one wade through to achieve such a
                     thing?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHADE_OFFER:</h2>
                  <p>I can return your regrets to you, if you share your
                     delicious food with me.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHADE_OFFER_INTRO:</h2>
                  <p>As a service, I can return your regrets to you, so
                     they can be dealt with. You want that, yes? Ah, but I am very hungry.
                     Perhaps you'd be willing to part with a little of your food? Sleep for as
                     long as I have and you build up quite the appetite.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHAMAN_TEMPLE:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                     stain in an ancestral mound... a place of strange worships.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WASTES:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     nestled amongst strange fungus and bubbling lakes.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WATERWAYS:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                     surrounded by pipes and running water. It can not be washed away,
                     though...</p>
