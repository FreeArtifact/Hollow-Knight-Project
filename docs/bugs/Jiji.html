            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>ABYSS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. Only faintly
                  though... a black stain deep below the world, surrounded by darkness. Almost
                  a part of it...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CITY</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain in
                  the heart of the kingdom's capital. Rain can not wash it away.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CLIFFS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  high above us, surrounded by howling winds.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>COLOSSEUM</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  surrounded by warriors and fools.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>CROSSROADS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  just below us, lost amongst the kingdom's twisting roads and
                  highways.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DECLINE</h2>Oh? Well, if you have no desire to reconcile with your
                  regrets, I can not help you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DEEPNEST</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain,
                  barely visible in the tunnels of a nest deep below this kingdom.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM</h2>How long I must have slept. This land is so much darker now, so
                  thick with the stains of regret. Even the air is murkier. If I sleep again,
                  will the darkness creep in here and swallow me whole?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FOG_CANYON</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  lost in the fog of a strange land.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREEN_PATH</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  in a lush, green land.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREET</h2>Ah, hello again. How have you been faring? Have you come to me
                  because of your regrets? Let me peer into you...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HIVE</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  surrounded by golden light, in a hive far away from here.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>KINGS_PASS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  nearby, right at the entrance to this kingdom.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>LOST_SHADE</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A black
                  stain hidden away in the darkness below us.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET1</h2>Welcome, small intruder. I've been sound asleep in here for some
                  time...Some, time? Ah. Yes. Yes. Well now you've gone and woken me up. It's
                  no matter, I suppose. I might even be able to help you.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET2</h2>I am Jiji, and if you have found your way into my chamber you
                  must need my help. You see, sometimes we leave our regrets behind in the
                  world, like black stains. If we don't deal with these regrets, hope starts
                  to drain from us. Do you have regrets of your own, little one? Let me peer
                  into you for a moment...</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MINES</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  almost hidden by the glow of shimmering crystals around it.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOSHADE</h2>Ah, you don't appear to have any lingering regrets. How lucky
                  for you. You don't need the services of one such as I.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NOSHADE_REPEAT</h2>You seem to be free of regret. You don't need the
                  services of one such as I. Farewell.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NO_EGGS</h2>Hmm, but you don't have any food on you. At least nothing that
                  interests me. I can't perform on an empty stomach, so please return once
                  you've found something truly tasty... something nourishing.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NO_EGGS_REPEAT</h2>The food I like... it's soft and round and bursts
                  delightfully in your mouth. The smell it emits... just thinking about is
                  getting me excited. It truly is the most sumptuous thing in the world. </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>OUTSKIRTS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  far way at the very edge of the world.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEENS_STATION</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                  stain sitting alone in the Queen's Station.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RESTING_GROUNDS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                  stain in a holy place of repose.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RITUAL_BEGIN</h2>Mmmm... I will enjoy this morsel tremendously. Now, as
                  promised, we will begin the ritual.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RITUAL_COMPLETED</h2>Ah, you seem to have made peace with your regrets in
                  a most novel, and dare I say brutal, fashion. What a joy to behold. Farewell
                  for now. I will think of you as I savour my meal.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RITUAL_REPEAT</h2>Farewell. I will think of you as I savour my
                  meal.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ROYAL_GARDENS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                  stain, marring a garden's beauty.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHADE_CHARM</h2>Ooohhhh. My masters would be impressed... Rare it is for
                  one to come to terms with their regrets so completely, yet you seem to have
                  managed it. What darkness must one wade through to achieve such a
                  thing?</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHADE_OFFER</h2>I can return your regrets to you, if you share your
                  delicious food with me.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHADE_OFFER_INTRO</h2>As a service, I can return your regrets to you, so
                  they can be dealt with. You want that, yes? Ah, but I am very hungry.
                  Perhaps you'd be willing to part with a little of your food? Sleep for as
                  long as I have and you build up quite the appetite.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>SHAMAN_TEMPLE</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark
                  stain in an ancestral mound... a place of strange worships.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WASTES</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  nestled amongst strange fungus and bubbling lakes.</li>
               <li>
                  <h2>WATERWAYS</h2>Yes, I can see the regrets you've left behind. A dark stain
                  surrounded by pipes and running water. It can not be washed away,
                  though...</li>
