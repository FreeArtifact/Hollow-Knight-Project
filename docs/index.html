            <h1>The Characters of Hollow Knight</h1>
            <p>This project is all about the characters of Hollow Knight. 
                Being such a vast and beautifully crafted world, it is hard for the average player
                to appreciate every character and interaction the game has to offer. 
                Fortunately, now there's a place where you can do just that!</p>
