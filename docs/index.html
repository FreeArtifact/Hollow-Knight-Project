            <h2>What is this Project?</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on the characters in the 2017 game <i>Hollow Knight</i>. Hollow Knight is a 2D 
                open-world action-adventure game that primarily takes place inside of Hallownest: a beautiful
                underground world home to all kinds of characters and experiences. 
            </p>
            <p>This project began as a more isolated study of the Hunter's journal and expanded from there.
                Although there are a number of wonderful websites and wikis dedicated to Hollow Knight, <em>
                    I wanted
                    to create an experience dedicated primarily to the bugs of Hallownest while studying the language and
                    dialogue featured in the game.
                </em>

                to appreciate each and every character or interaction the game has to offer. Now there's a place where you can do just that!</p> -->
