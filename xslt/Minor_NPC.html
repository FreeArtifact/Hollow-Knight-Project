                     of these lands? This ashen place is grave of Wyrm. Once told, it came to
                     die. But what is death for that ancient being? More transformation methinks.
                     This failed kingdom is product of the being spawned from that event.</p>

                     light. Theirs is a different kind of unity. Rejection of the Wyrm's attempt
                     at order. I resist the light's allure. Union it may offer, but also a mind
                     bereft of thought... To instinct alone a bug is reduced...Hrrm...</p>

                  <p> The White Saviour The maiden woke in darkness.
                     Confused she reached out. Sharp brambles jabbed at all sides. Burning acid
                     bubbled close below. What nightmare had led her here? What hope of survival
                     remained? Doomed she thought herself and to despair she fell, until a light
                     bloomed far in the distance, a bright, glowing spot fast approaching. It
                     swept majestic about the thorns, leapt above burning waters and dove towards
                     the maiden. Coming close, the form revealed at last, a beautiful being,
                     sharp horns gleaming white. Arms reached out for the damsel, gathering her

                  <p> The White Saviour Returns Long had they remained apart
                     and the village, once so warm, now grew cold. The maiden felt the well of
                     grief. It gripped fierce about her lonely shell. And suddenly, as though her
                     tragic state was sensed, the saviour returned, standing tall, glowing
                     bright. Below shining horns, eyes welled black, glistening, eyes only for
                     the maiden long missed, long desired. Her saviour leaned close, sat beside,
                     perfectly composed. In that charged, breathless moment not a word needed be
                     spoken, The maiden's shell felt suddenly tight. Her claws curled. No glance
                     was shared, no claws touched, just perfect, aching love shared in silence,
                     together...</p>

                     cold wind, moaning at her door. Her heart fluttered with sudden fear... Then
                     still. A sudden calm. Why? A presence. A figure close behind. She doesn't
                     dare look, doesn't dare move, fearful the slightest action would break the
                     spell. She knew the presence at her bed, knew the calm only they could
                     bring. Her white saviour, now protector, standing tall beside, powerful,

                     and deadly combat. All one has to do is place their mark upon their Trial
                     Board of choice and lo! The arena's gate will open. There's a small fee
                     attached to each trial, but I'm sure as skilled a combatant as yourself will
                     have accrued a wealth of Geo. Now, before you draw your nail and rush
                     eagerly to battle, I'll offer one quick word of advice. There's a warriors'
                     pit just below here, where others like yourself await their own trials. I'd
                     strongly advise using it to rest up before placing your mark. Oh and have no
                     doubt, I'm a fearsome warrior myself. Don't go judging me by my size, or my
                     current... errr... constraint. The Colosseum beckons us both! I'll be back

                  <p>Ahhhh.... Me'hon. This world. This cruel, sinful world. Why
                     does che' wake? Why does che' persist? Ahhh Le'mer, you could not know of
                     tragedy as complete as che's, true lovers stripped apart, two worlds that
                     could not meet. And now meled'lover, dead so long in time. Dead, so far
                     away. Buried, moina? Ai. Amongst its hateful kin that did deny our union,
                     that did reject che's... outside-ness. She doesn't suppose?... Nahlo, Nahlo.
                     Could che' ask? Could che' burden? Le'mer, woulds't you, coulds't you
                     deliver gift to her grave? The gift is, maybe small? But the trek is long.
                     She rests amongst her kind near our Queen's lush refuge. Would such a thing
                     be done? Che' asks perhaps impossible things? Mad things? For Le'mer to take
                     up such quest would be a kindness che' has near forgotten. </p>

                     This world's cruelty, I'd thought it overwhelming, but le'mer, such great
                     compassion. That Che's love would know her partner's heart even aeon
