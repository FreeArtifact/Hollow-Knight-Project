                  <p>To think, such a small creature would bear this

                  <p>What is this feeling?... So familiar. Drawn forward
                     yet repelled. And those shapes upon the door...To gaze directly at them
                     turns my mind to fog.</p>

                  <h2>DREAM_LAKE:</h2>
                  <p>To live an age, yet remember so little... Perhaps I should
                     be thankful? All tragedy erased. I see only wonders...</p>

                  <p>This one too must seek the village at the nest's heart. What

                  <p>Again we meet, my short friend. Here at last, I feel
                     at peace. Twice I've seen this world and though my service may have stripped
                     the first experience from me, I'm thankful I could witness its beauty again.
                     Hallownest is a vast and wondrous thing, but with as many wonders as it
                     holds, I've seen none quite so intriguing as you. Ha. My flattery returns
                     only silent stoicism. I like that. I like that very much.</p>

                  <h2>FOGCANYON_A:</h2>
                  <p>Doesn't this kingdom just abound with surprises? A
                     building atop an acid lake. Despite the sight, I can't help but feel...
                     familiarity? Something stirs in my mind, though I can't yet tell what.. I'd
                     thought it my lust for discovery that led me here but now there seems
                     something else. This building beckons me.</p>

                  <h2>FOGCANYON_B:</h2>
                  <p>I can feel it calling... Dare I head in? </p>

                  <h2>GREENPATH_1:</h2>
                  <p>Oh, hello there! Seems we both tread far from the
                     path. I can hardly believe those dusty old highways led to such a lush and
                     lively place! This building suggests some form of worship, though its idol
                     has clearly been long forgotten. Doubles equally well for a moment's
                     respite.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREENPATH_2:</h2>
                  <p>I saw a strange fellow out there. He seemed quite
                     taken by the lake. I'd planned to offer greetings, though figured I'd first
                     tend to my nail on chance our meeting goes poorly. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREENPATH_3:</h2>
                  <p>Your nail looks a fine instrument, but it's showing
                     signs of wear. I'd wager up there it would take you far. Down here however,
                     I suspect you'll soon meet dangers the surface world can't match.</p>

                  <h2>GREENPATH_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Hallownest is perfect for vigilant explorers
                     like us. So tense and thrilling. In this place, you're either alert or
                     you're dead.</p>

               <li>
                  <h2>MANTIS_01:</h2>
                  <p>Hello again! I suppose you've already met with the
                     tribe of this village, hmm? They seem a little distrustful of strangers...
                     to put it lightly. They're not brutes though, no. The sickness in the air
                     that clouds the mind of lesser beasts... they resist it. They retain their
                     intellect and their honour, though also their lethal traditions. I've some
                     words of advice, my friend. If you plan to challenge the lords of this
                     tribe, your blunted nail may prove inadequate. There is a city nearby, the
                     old capital of Hallownest. I've heard a Nailsmith resides there. Seek the
                     old bug out and you may find progress that much easier.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MANTIS_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>My own route takes me towards that great city. If
                     you search out the Nailsmith, it may not be long until our paths cross
                     again.</p>

                  <h2>MEET_TEMPLE:</h2>
                  <p>Hello there! How delightful to meet another traveller
                     on these forgotten roads. You're a short one, but you've a strong look about
                     you.</p>

               <li>
                  <h2>MEET_TEMPLE_B:</h2>
                  <p>I'm Quirrel. I have something of an obsession with
                     uncharted places. This ancient kingdom holds many fascinating mysteries, and
                     one of the most intriguing of them is standing right before us.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET_TEMPLE_C:</h2>
                  <p>A great stone egg, lying in the corpse of an
                     ancient kingdom. And this egg...Is it warm? It certainly gives off a unique
                     air. Can it be opened? There are strange marks all over it... I do so love a
                     mystery...And who knows what other marvels lie even deeper below
                     us...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MINES_1:</h2>
                  <p>Ahh, quite a view, no? I'm not surprised you survived the
                     trek through these shimmering caverns. There's an air of strength about you.
                     I suspect it would be quite intimidating, if not for your small
                     stature.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MINES_2:</h2>
                  <p>Did it sadden you to see those miners below, still
                     labouring at their endless task? Even overcome, strong purpose has been
                     imprinted upon their husks. The crystal ore is said to contain a sort of
                     energy, not as powerful as the soul the city dwellers harnessed but far less
                     lethal. ...Strange to know such ancient facts. I wonder from where my
                     knowledge comes?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MINES_3:</h2>
                  <p>At this high vantage I can just make it out, the light
                     from that sad little town. I doubt its residents could even comprehend the
                     scale of the world that surrounds them.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MINES_4:</h2>
                  <p>So small it seems...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NODREAMNAIL:</h2>
                  <p>Ahh, but her mind is still locked to you. That final,
                     powerful protection stays in place. If you would attempt to break her seal,
                     you've first to discover the means to open a mind. Such tools may exist to
                     perform the feat, though in my own travels I've not come across one. I'd
                     heard it told the Kingdom's moths did delve amongst dreams and the dead.
                     Perhaps you'd seek them out?</p>

                  <h2>QUEENSTATION_01:</h2>
                  <p>Isn't this something. I'd not expected to
                     discover so huge a Stag Station after that foggy descent. The bugs of
                     Hallownest must've been an impressive lot, building such grand structures so
                     far into these wilds. Seems the dangerous creatures about haven't yet made
                     their way in here. It's the perfect place for a quick rest.</p>

                  <h2>QUEENSTATION_02:</h2>
                  <p>Can you imagine this place in its time? Hordes of
                     bugs travelling about the Kingdom; stag bells ringing; the station bustling
                     with activity and life. Now only our like even know it exists. That's a
                     special thing I suppose, to cherish these sights, even in their
                     decay.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEENSTATION_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Is it that, just faintly, you can still hear
                     the echo of the bells?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RUINS_1:</h2>
                  <p>The capital lies before us my friend. What a sombre place
                     it seems and one that holds the answers to many a mystery. I too have felt
                     the pull of this place, though now I sit before it I find myself hesitant to
                     descend. Is it fear I wonder, or something else that holds me back? </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RUINS_2:</h2>
                  <p>The city looks to be built into an enormous cavern, and
                     the rain pours down from cracks in the stone above. There must be a lot of
                     water up there somewhere. I suppose, if the cave roof stayed strong this
                     long, it should hold for us. Before I leave this Kingdom, I'd like to see
                     where all that water comes from. What a sight it must be!</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>RUINS_3:</h2>
                  <p>If you look down from here, through the rain, you can
                     just make out those twisted sentries, their husks still stuck in endless
                     patrol. I'd be cautious around them my short friend. Their training will not
                     have been forgotten. This city presents some formidable foes.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RUINS_4:</h2>
                  <p>Isn't this a wonderful spot for a rest? I so love the
                     sound of the rain upon glass.</p>

                  <p>Hello, hello! What a thrill this is, to find such warm
                     comfort amidst the den of beasts. This is a ferocious place no doubt.
                     Supposedly, there's a village deep in the warren. Its inhabitants never
                     accepted Hallownest's King.</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>SPA_REPEAT:</h2>
                  <p>Why not join me for a time? These waters do wonders

                  <h2>TEACHER_1A:</h2>
                  <p>Did she call you too then? I realise it's no
                     coincidence we arrive together. Though much of my memory is blank, this
                     place I recall. Within these chambers the Teacher sought to store the
                     Kingdom's knowledge and at its core, she stored herself.</p>
               </li>

                  <h2>TEACHER_1B:</h2>
                  <p>To save Hallownest, the Teacher willingly became a
                     seal, but upon herself she enacted an additional protection. Though I cannot
                     recall its happening, I played a part in that feat.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TEACHER_1C:</h2>
                  <p>She called me here, now, to reverse that protection.
                     All in aid of you.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TEACHER_2:</h2>
                  <p>Do not hesitate. The choice to reform was hers, not
                     mine. She knows what you would do and seems to welcome it. </p>

                  <h2>TEACHER_3:</h2>
                  <p>The Madam's life is extinguished and with it her seal
                     breaks. It's a heavy thing you attempt, but I've seen your prowess up close
                     and she too believed you capable. Be on your journey then, and allow me rest
                     a time. With the deed complete, I begin to feel my age.</p>

                  <p>Why do you hesitate? Mercy is a fine thing, but
                     you and her agree this must be done. Be brave, friend.</p>

                  <p>For so long I've felt drawn here. So many tales full of
                     wonders and horrors. No longer could I resist. I just had to see it for
                     myself. And what a time I chose to arrive! This dead world has sprung to
                     life. The creatures are riled up and the earth rumbles. The air is thick. I
                     wonder what could have brought it all about?</p>

                  <p>To persevere in this ruin, that old nail alone just
                     won't be enough. Though that's no problem! One only has to look around.
                     Plenty have come before us and most have met their grisly end, many more
                     equipped than you and I. I'm sure they wouldn't mind were a fellow explorer
                     to relieve them of their tools. It's a kindness really. The dead shouldn't
                     be burdened with such things.</p>

                  <p>Did you pass that town above? What a gloomy little
                     place. And such majesty hidden right beneath! I suppose that's why they've
                     all headed down here. Who could resist such possibilities?</p>
