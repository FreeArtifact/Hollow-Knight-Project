            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>CROSSROADS:</h2>
                  <p>It was a long time ago, but I remember when these
                     highways and crossroads pulsed with life. These are the paths I first
                     carried passengers through when I was young. Those travellers are long gone,
                     yet still I remain. Now it seems it's just you and I and the furtive
                     creatures scratching and squirming all around us.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DEEPNEST:</h2>
                  <p>Ahh, little one... Where are we? I have never been to
                     this station. It has a strange air of danger to it. Let me take you
                     somewhere safer, quickly.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM:</h2>
                  <p>I tire so easily now, and my old legs seem to ache more and
                     more. Still, I'm lucky to grow old at all... so many others haven't.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>EGG_INSPECT:</h2>
                  <p>An empty eggshell.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>END_SPEAK:</h2>
                  <p>Eager to travel the stagways? Just hop upon that
                     platform, give me the signal and we'll soon be on our way.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FLOWER_WARNING:</h2>
                  <p>That flower you're carrying... It looks quite
                     beautiful, but also very delicate. I fear if you travel with me it will be
                     ruined. If you need to keep it intact, I'd suggest using your own legs to
                     carry it to its destination.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FUNGUS:</h2>
                  <p>Ahh, this gladdens me. The Queen's Station has opened once
                     more. This place was a bustling hub of travel, well-placed for travellers
                     visiting the outer edges of the land. You're quite the explorer to find this
                     place.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREENPATH:</h2>
                  <p>My, this place is much changed since I last saw it. The
                     greenery grows so wild the station's like to be consumed by it.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HIDDEN:</h2>
                  <p>Ah! What station is this, hidden all the way at the bottom
                     of the world? Until I heard the bell calling, I didn't even know the
                     Stagways travelled so deep. You've discovered something quite astounding,
                     little one! No matter how old I grow, the world still keeps surprises like
                     this stowed away...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HOPE_1:</h2>
                  <p>What do you think of my old home, little one? It was full
                     of life, once. Stags coming and going, swapping stories of the places they'd
                     been and the passengers they'd met. For a long time now, I've considered
                     myself the only one remaining. The last stag. But being in the Nest again...
                     there's something in the air. A smell, or a warmth, or a presence perhaps?
                     Could it be, other stags have made their way out into the wider
                     world?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HOPE_2:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I will hold onto that hope. My kin, still alive,
                     still out there, journeying beyond these lands. But for me, I could never
                     abandon the stagways. Not as long as passengers still need them. I can tell
                     you still have important work to do. I will be your companion as long as my
                     old body still serves. Let us enjoy the old stagways of this kingdom
                     together a little longer.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET:</h2>
                  <p>Greetings, little one! It's been an age since I last heard
                     the ringing of a station bell. It echoed down the stagways and called me to
                     you. I've grown stiff and tired over these many years and I've forgotten
                     much, but the sound of the bell will always call me back. These stagways
                     stretch the depths of Hallownest. If you want to travel them, hail me from
                     the platform. I will take you where you need to go.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>NEST:</h2>
                  <p>Being back in my old home... I feel the weight of my long
                     life bearing down on me. I carry it proudly, though. Wherever I travel, the
                     memories of my family and my kind come with me.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REMEMBER_1:</h2>
                  <p>You've opened several stag stations now, haven't you?
                     I'm thankful for the opportunity to once more travel through the kingdom. As
                     I visit more places I feel my memories returning to me, like the stagways of
                     my mind are running once more. Continue to open the stations and you'll have
                     my deepest gratitude.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REMEMBER_2:</h2>
                  <p>Ahh, many stag stations have been opened. Again I can
                     travel the breadth of the kingdom. So many grand thoroughfares and old
                     sideways I'd forgotten. Somewhere amongst the lines lies the Stag Nest, the
                     place where I was born and raised. I'd thought its location lost to my
                     failing mind, but now I can almost remember the path. If you keep opening
                     stag stations and beckoning me through them, perhaps I'll again find that
                     Nest. Ahh, I would like that very much!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REMEMBER_3:</h2>
                  <p>Little one! I've found it! The Stag Nest, where I was
                     born and raised. I've yet to go there again. My duty binds me to travel only
                     where I am called, but if you wished to see it yourself, I could take you
                     there. None may remain to welcome us, but the nest is still a sight to
                     behold! Give me the word, and we will go there at once.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RESTINGGROUNDS:</h2>
                  <p>The Resting Grounds... Passengers would come here
                     to conduct rituals for those who had passed on. Not any more though. Perhaps
                     the dead conduct their own rituals now?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>ROYALGARDENS:</h2>
                  <p>Before you rang the bell, I'd almost forgotten this
                     station existed. It was not often used by the common bugs, being a
                     well-guarded retreat for our late Queen. Even as overgrown as they've
                     become, these gardens are still beautiful after all this time. I'm sure the
                     Queen would be happy to know that.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RUINS1:</h2>
                  <p>I remember this station well. A common trip it was. Goods
                     from all over the kingdom were transported here. Not a lot was sent back the
                     other way though.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>RUINS2:</h2>
                  <p>Little one, we stand in the King's Station! Named of
                     course for the King of Hallownest, he who ordered the building of the
                     stagways and stations. The King never rode the stagways himself, but I've
                     heard he was a glorious bug to behold, bright and radiant in visage, so much
                     so it hurt to look at him.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TISO:</h2>
                  <p>I see another takes rest upon the bench. There's something
                     unpleasant about that one, but a stag station's doors are open to all. If he
                     requests passage, I'll offer it gladly. My duty as a stag far outweighs any
                     personal distaste. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TOWN:</h2>
                  <p>This place... we are near the surface, I believe? There is a
                     town here. You should take the opportunity to rest. This place was once full
                     of travellers coming and going. It seems much quieter now.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TRAM:</h2>
                  <p>That pass you hold! Is it not for that ghastly machine, the
                     tram? I hope you're not thinking of riding on that grotesque contraption.
                     The thought a mere machine could attempt what we stags do! Foolish...Very
                     foolish.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>TRAVEL_1:</h2>
                  <p>Ready to go, little one?</p>
