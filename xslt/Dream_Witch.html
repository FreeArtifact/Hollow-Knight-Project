            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM:</h2>
                  <p>What are you doing, poking about in a dusty old mind like
                     mine? Nothing of worth is hidden inside, believe me. But keep probing the
                     world around you with your Dream Nail... Hidden things will reveal
                     themselves.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM1:</h2>
                  <p>What a terrible fate they've visited upon you. To cast
                     you away into this space between body and soul. Will you accept their
                     judgement and fade slowly away? Or will you take the weapon before you, and
                     cut your way out of this sad, forgotten dream?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>DREAM_FALL:</h2>
                  <p>Though you may fall, your will shall carry you
                     forward. A dream is endless, but a Kingdom is not. The power to wake this
                     world from its slumber... you only need to reach out and take it.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FINAL_1:</h2>
                  <p>So much Essence... So bright.... You truly are the
                     Wielder my tribe so long has dreamed of. The folk of my tribe were born from
                     a light. Light similar to Essence, similar to that powerful blade, though
                     much brighter still. They were content to bask in that light and honoured
                     it... for a time. But another light appeared in our world... A wyrm that
                     took the form of a king. How fickle my ancestors must have been. They
                     forsook the light that spawned them. Turned their backs to it... Forgot it
                     even.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FINAL_2:</h2>
                  <p>And so this kingdom was born from that betrayal. But the
                     memories of that ancient light still lingered, hush whispers of faith...
                     Until all of Hallownest began to dream of that forgotten light. Ah, but
                     what's done is done. And so am I. The Wielder has at last appeared and I've
                     held the memories of my tribe for long enough. It is time for us to be
                     forgotten too. Don't remember us, Wielder. Don't honour us. We do not
                     deserve it...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>FINAL_3:</h2>
                  <p>Aahh... I'm sorry... Light... Radiance... I... remember
                     you.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GENERIC:</h2>
                  <p>This kingdom is full of old memories, both beautiful and
                     grotesque. Seek them out, reveal them, and gather Essence.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>GREET:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, Wielder, you've returned. Let me have a look at the
                     Dream Nail...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_DREAMPLANT:</h2>
                  <p>Essence can be found wherever dreams take root.
                     Have you seen them? Those whispering plants that grow all over this old
                     Kingdom? I believe there is one just outside. Why not strike it with your
                     Dream Nail, and see what happens?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>HINT_XERO:</h2>
                  <p>Sometimes dreams take the shape of those who have
                     passed away. Such dreams are bountiful sources of Essence! You should search
                     carefully near graves and other monuments. Why, I believe I saw an
                     interesting gravestone here in the Resting Grounds. If you do decide to
                     disturb those dreams though, be prepared for a fight...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>INTRO:</h2>
                  <p>Those figures, those Dreamers... they reached out with
                     what little power they still have and dragged you into that hidden place.
                     But that talisman you now wield, the Dream Nail... it can cut through the
                     veil that separates the waking world from our dreams. Even the Dreamers
                     themselves can not hide from such a weapon. Though I must admit, that sacred
                     blade has dulled over time. Together perhaps, we can restore its power. You
                     only have to bring me Essence. Essence... the precious fragments of light
                     that dreams are made of. Collect it wherever you find it, and bring it to
                     me. Once we have enough, we can work wonders together. Go out into the
                     world, Wielder. Hunt down the Essence that lingers there! Collect 100
                     Essence and return to me. I will teach you more...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET_A:</h2>
                  <p>Ahhhh, you've returned. Welcome back to the waking
                     world.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>MEET_B:</h2>
                  <p>Ahhhh, you've found your way back to me. When you awoke
                     you just up and left. I thought perhaps I'd frightened you.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_1:</h2>
                  <p>Hm. You are still unpracticed in the way of dreams.
                     Collect 100 Essence with the Dream Nail; visit me again and I will share
                     what little wisdom I have.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_2:</h2>
                  <p>You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but
                     you still have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 200
                     Essence.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_3:</h2>
                  <p>You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but
                     you still have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 300
                     Essence.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_4:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail,
                     haven't you? Return to me once you have collected 500 Essence and I will
                     teach you more.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_5:</h2>
                  <p>Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail,
                     haven't you? Return to me once you have collected 700 Essence and I will
                     teach you more.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_5B:</h2>
                  <p>My my, you're almost starting to become a dream
                     yourself! Once you have collected 900 Essence I'll teach you a trick that
                     I've kept hidden for a long time...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_6:</h2>
                  <p>Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up.
                     Return to me once you have collected 1200 Essence.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_7:</h2>
                  <p>Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up,
                     return to me once you have collected 1500 Essence.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_8:</h2>
                  <p>Incredible... the Dream Nail, it is so close to fully
                     awakening! Collect more Essence! Once you have 1800 Essence, something truly
                     marvellous will happen!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>QUEST_9:</h2>
                  <p>The Dream Nail has fully awoken, yet still you collect
                     Essence. Perhaps I've instilled an obsession in you? Keep at it, then! I'm
                     happy to wait and watch your progress. Once you have collected 2400 Essence,
                     return to me. I've no more gifts to give... but you'd prove yourself the
                     Wielder my tribe awaited.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_1:</h2>
                  <p>Hmm, already you've collected 100 Essence. Quick work!
                     Things come naturally to you, don't they? No wonder the Dreamers tried to
                     bury you in that old dream. Perhaps you frighten them? Or perhaps, being
                     prisoners themselves, they desired your company? In any case, you still have
                     a long way to go. Take this old trinket as encouragement from me, and return
                     when you have collected 200 Essence.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_2A:</h2>
                  <p>Ahhh... Your Dream Nail holds over 200 Essence. You're
                     proving your talent in its collection. Have you seen that great door just
                     outside? My tribe closed it long ago and forbade its opening. Ah, but as far
                     as I can tell I'm the only member of my tribe still breathing. That means I
                     needn't feel bad about breaking a taboo. As proof of my belief in you, I'll
                     open the door.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_2B:</h2>
                  <p>There, the door is open and you can enter the glade
                     beyond it. Listen closely in there and you may hear the utterings of bugs
                     long gone.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_3:</h2>
                  <p>So you've collected 300 Essence... Yes, I can see the
                     dreams of this old Kingdom are starting to cling to you. Very encouraging.
                     You've certainly made my dreary work here more exciting. Being the caretaker
                     of this place hasn't been very stimulating. I shouldn't complain though.
                     Tending these graves and guiding the Wielder... all penitence for old
                     crimes. Certain things have to be kept in balance. Take this trinket for
                     your efforts, and return with 500 Essence. Keep up your tireless
                     work!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_4:</h2>
                  <p>Ahhhhh. 500 Essence. You're a master in the making.
                     Well done! Well done! I've a small reward for you. Plucked from one of my
                     most precious memories, this Charm will bring you and the Dream Nail closer
                     together still. The secrets of this kingdom won't be able to hide from you
                     any longer! Take it, and return once you have collected 700 Essence. More
                     gifts await you...</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_5:</h2>
                  <p>So, you already have 700 Essence. I wonder whether the
                     Dreamers are watching you as you work. Or even that old King. That lock of
                     theirs. Desperate, but very clever. I wonder how long they thought it could
                     hold? I hold no disdain for them though. As history goes on I grow numb to
                     its repetitions. Take your gift and continue collecting Essence. Once you
                     have 900, come back and visit me.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_5B:</h2>
                  <p>The Dream Nail now holds 900 Essence within its core!
                     Are you surprised that this old kingdom has so many hidden dreams? Yes,
                     you're starting to see them. The connections between us and the dreams we
                     leave behind, like prints in the dust. The time has come for you to learn
                     how to revisit the places connected to you! Hold the Dream Nail tight,
                     wielder, and imagine a great gate opening before you!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_6:</h2>
                  <p>The Dream Nail glows bright... It holds over 1200
                     Essence. Looking into it I can see so many memories peering back at me. So
                     many asking to be remembered. None of us can live forever, and so we ask
                     those who survive to remember us. Hold something in your mind and it lives
                     on with you, but forget it and you seal it away forever. That is the only
                     death that matters. Huh, so they say! Enough of that though. Take this relic
                     and come back to me with 1500 Essence. Go!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_7:</h2>
                  <p>Yes, I thought so. More than 1500 Essence. The Dream
                     Nail is close... so close to fully awakening! Continue on your path,
                     Wielder. I know not what guides you, nor what will it is that drives you
                     forward. Once you have collected 1800 Essence though, I will be here
                     waiting. Take this gift, may it grant you strength and help you to collect
                     the Essence of this world!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h2>REWARD_8A:</h2>
                  <p>Yes. The time has come. The Dream Nail... And you as
                     well, Wielder. It is time for you both to awaken. The Essence you have
                     collected...The hope that still remains in this old Kingdom. Pure potential!
                     Let it course through you and into the Dream Nail. Hold it aloft, Wielder!
                     Awaken! </p>
               </li>

                  <h2>REWARD_8B:</h2>
                  <p>Ahhhh, ah ha, yes... No dream can hide itself from you
                     now. You can peer into the darkest places... You just need to find the right
                     crack. What will you do with such a power, Wielder? Whose memories will you
                     hunt down? Hah. Do as you wish, my promise is fulfilled. May the crimes of
                     my tribe be washed away in time, like the rest of this Kingdom's...</p>
